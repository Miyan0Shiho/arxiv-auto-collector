## Abstract
As an effective method to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the question answering (QA) task, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which queries highly relevant information from external complex documents, has attracted tremendous attention from both industry and academia. Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that BookRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines in both retrieval recall and QA accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency.

Abstract
As an effective method to boost the performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on the question answering (QA) task, Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG), which queries highly relevant in-
formation from external complex documents, has attracted tremen-
dous attention from both industry and academia. Existing RAG
approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook
the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets,
handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes
their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor per-
formance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we intro-
duce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents
with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and
traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information.
Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by
extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as
the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intri-
cate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree
nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based
query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which
dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval work-
flow. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks
demonstrate that BookRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming baselines in both retrieval recall and
QA accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Qwen 3 [ 60] and Gemini
2.5 [ 13] have revolutionized the Question Answering (QA) sys-
tem [ 15,61,65]. The industry has increasingly adopted LLMs to
build QA systems that assist users and reduce manual effort in
many applications [ 65,67], such as financial auditing [ 29,37], legal
compliance [ 8], and scientific discovery [ 56]. However, directly
relying on LLMs may lead to missing domain knowledge and gen-
erating outdated or unsupported information. To address these
issues, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely
adopted [ 17,22] by retrieving relevant domain knowledge from
external sources and using it to guide the LLM during response
generation. On the other hand, in real-world enterprise scenarios,
domain knowledge is often stored in long-form documents, such
as technical handbooks, API reference manuals, and operational
guidebooks [ 49]. A notable feature of such documents is that they
follow the structure of books, characterized by intricate layouts and
rigorous logical hierarchies (e.g., explicit tables of contents, nested
chapters, and multi-level sections). In this paper, we aim to design
an effective RAG system for QA over long and highly structured
documents.
Figure 1: Comparison of existing methods and BookRAG for
complex document QA.
•Prior works.The existing RAG approaches for document-
level QA generally fall into two paradigms, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The first paradigm relies on OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
to convert the document into plain text, after which any text-based
RAG method can be directly applied. Among text-based RAG meth-
ods, state-of-the-art approaches increasingly adoptgraph-based
RAG[ 6,62,66], where graph data serves as an external knowl-
edge source because it captures rich semantic information and the
relational structure between entities. As shown in Table 1, two rep-
resentative methods are GraphRAG [ 16] and RAPTOR [ 45]. Specif-
ically, GraphRAG first constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from
the textual corpus, and then applies the Leiden community detec-
tion algorithm [ 51] to obtain hierarchical clusters. Summaries are
generated for each community, providing a comprehensive, global
overview of the entire corpus. RAPTOR builds a recursive tree struc-
ture by iteratively clustering document chunks and summarizing
them at each level, enabling the model to capture both fine-grained
and high-level semantic information across the corpus.
In contrast, the second paradigm,layout-aware segmentation[ 5,
52], first parses the document into structured blocks that preserve
the original layout and information of the document, such as para-
graphs, tables, figures, or equations. By doing so, it not only avoids
the fixed chunk size used in the first paradigm, which often leadsarXiv:2512.03413v1  [cs.IR]  3 Dec 2025

to fragmented information, but also retains document-native struc-
tural information. These blocks often exhibit multimodal charac-
teristics, and a typical approach is to apply multimodal retrieval to
obtain relevant content for answering queries. Recently, a state-of-
the-art method in this category, DocETL [ 47], provides a declarative
interface that allows users to manually define LLM-based process-
ing pipelines to analyze the retrieved blocks. These pipelines consist
of LLM-powered operations combined with task-specific optimiza-
tions.
•Limitations of existing works.However, these methods
suffer from two fundamental limitations (Lfor short):L1: Failure
to capture the deep connection of document structure and
semantics.Text-based approaches cannot capture the structural
layout of the document, resulting in the loss of important relation-
ships stored in the hierarchical blocks, such as tables nested within
a specific section. While layout-segmented methods preserve doc-
ument structure, they cannot capture the relationships between
different blocks in the document, which limits their capability for
multi-hop reasoning across these blocks and ultimately affects their
overall performance.L2: Static of query workflows.In real-world
QA scenarios, user queries are highly heterogeneous, ranging from
simple keyword lookups to complex multi-hop questions that re-
quire synthesizing evidence scattered across different parts of the
document. Applying a uniform strategy, such as static or manually
predefined workflows, to diverse needs is inefficient; for example,
complex queries often require question decomposition, whereas
simple queries do not.
•Our technical contributions.To bridge this gap, we intro-
duceBookRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation method
built upon a document-nativeBookIndex, designed to document
QA tasks. Specifically, to capture the deep connection of the rela-
tion in the document, BookIndex organizes information through
two complementary structures. First, to preserve the document’s
native logical hierarchy, we organize the parsed content blocks into
a hierarchical tree structure, which serves as the role of its table
of contents. Second, to capture the intricate relations within these
blocks, we construct a KG containing fine-grained entities. Finally,
we unify these two structures by mapping the KG entities to their
corresponding tree nodes.
However, effective multi-hop reasoning on the graph relies on a
high-quality KG [ 62,66], which is often compromised by entity am-
biguity (e.g., distinct entities with names like “LLM” and “Large Lan-
guage Model”). To address this, we propose a novel gradient-based
entity resolution method that analyzes the similarity distribution ofcandidate entities. By identifying sharp drops in similarity scores,
we can efficiently distinguish and merge coreferent entities, thereby
ensuring graph connectivity and enhancing reasoning capabilities.
Building upon the BookIndex, we address the static of query
workflows (L2) by implementing anagent-based retrieval. Specif-
ically, our agent first classifies user queries based on their intent
and complexity, and then dynamically generates tailored retrieval
workflows. Grounded inInformation Foraging Theory[ 42], our re-
trieval process mimics foraging by usingSelectorto narrow down
the search space via information scents andReasonerto locate
highly relevant evidence.
We conduct extensive experiments on three widely adopted
datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our BookRAG,
comparing it against several state-of-the-art baselines. The exper-
imental results demonstrate that BookRAG consistently achieves
superior performance in both retrieval recall and QA accuracy
across all datasets. Furthermore, our detailed analysis validates the
critical contributions of our key features, such as the high-quality
KG and the agent-based retrieval mechanism.
We summarize our contributions as:
•We introduceBookRAG, a novel method that constructs a
document-nativeBookIndexby integrating a hierarchical
tree of document layout blocks with a KG storing fine-
grained entity relations.
•We propose anAgent-based Retrievalapproach inspired
by Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classi-
fies queries and configures optimal retrieval workflows to
locate highly relevant evidence within documents.
•Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that
BookRAGsignificantly outperforms existing baselines, at-
taining state-of-the-art performance in solving complex
document QA tasks while maintaining competitive effi-
ciency.

BookRAG: A Hierarchical Structure-aware Index-based Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Complex Documents
•LLM in document analysis.Recent advances in LLMs have
offered opportunities to leverage LLMs in document data analy-
sis. Due to the robust semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
there is an increasing number of works focusing on transferring
unstructured documents (e.g., HTML, PDFs, and raw text) into
structured formats, such as relational tables [ 1,7,25,38]. For ex-
ample, Evaporate [ 1] utilizes LLMs to synthesize extraction code,
enabling cost-effective conversion of semi-structured web docu-
ments into structured databases without heavy manual annotation.
In addition, several LLM-based document analysis systems have
been proposed to equip standard data pipelines with semantic un-
derstanding [ 28,40,47,53]. For instance, LOTUS [ 40] extends the
relational model with semantic operators, allowing users to execute
SQL-like queries with LLM-powered predicates (e.g., filter, join)
over unstructured text corpora. Similarly, DocETL [ 47] introduces
an agentic framework to optimize complex information extraction
tasks. Furthermore, another line of research proposes to directly
analyze or parse documents by viewing the document pages as
images, thereby preserving critical layout and visual information
[26, 31, 54].
•RAG approaches.RAG has been proven to excel in many
tasks, including open-ended question answering [ 24,48], program-
ming context [ 9,10], SQL rewrite [ 30,50], and data cleaning [ 35,36,
43]. The naive RAG technique relies on retrieving query-relevant
contexts from external knowledge bases to mitigate the “halluci-
nation” of LLMs. Recently, many RAG approaches [ 16,18,19,21,
27,32,32,45,55,58,66] have adopted graph structures to organize
the information and relationships within documents, achieving im-
proved overall retrieval performance. For more details, please refer
to the recent survey of graph-based RAG methods [ 41]. Besides,
the Agentic RAG paradigm has been widely studied, employing
autonomous agents to dynamically orchestrate and refine the RAG
pipeline, thus significantly boosting the reasoning robustness and
generation fidelity [2, 23, 59].
3 Preliminaries
This section formalizes the research problem of complex document
QA, introduces the foundational Information Foraging Theory (IFT),
and briefly reviews the general workflow of RAG systems
3.1 Problem Formulation
We study the problem of Question Answering (QA) over complex
documents, which aims to answer user queries based on long-form
documents [ 5,11,33]. Formally, a document 𝐷is represented as a
sequence of 𝑁pages,𝐷={𝑃𝑖}𝑁
𝑖=1. These pages collectively contain
a sequence of content blocks B={𝑏𝑗}𝑀
𝑗=1, where each block 𝑏𝑗
represents a distinct element (e.g., text segment, section header,
table, or image) organized within a logical chapter hierarchy. Given
a user query 𝑞, the goal is to generate an accurate answer 𝐴, ideally
grounded in a specific set of evidence blocks 𝐸⊂B . The task is
formulated as developing a method Sthat maps the structured
document and the query to the final answer:
𝐴=S(𝐷,𝑞)(1)
whereSshould navigate both the sequential page content and the
logical hierarchy of𝐷to synthesize the response.3.2 Information Foraging Theory
Information Foraging Theory (IFT) [ 42] provides a framework for
understanding information access as a process analogous to animal
foraging. It suggests that users follow cues, known asinformation
scent(e.g., keywords or icons), to navigate between clusters of con-
tent, known asinformation patches(e.g., sections in handbooks).
The goal is to maximize the rate of valuable information gain while
minimizing effort, guiding the decision to either stay within a patch
or seek a new one.
Consider experts seeking a solution to a specific problem within a
large technical handbook. They first extract key terms related to the
problem, which act as information scent. This scent guides them to
navigate towards one or more promising sections (the information
patches). Within these patches, they analyze the diverse content to
extract the precise knowledge required to formulate a final answer
3.3 RAG workflow
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate
in a two-phase framework [ 6,16,41]. In theOffline Indexing
phase, unstructured corpus data is organized into a structured index,
which can take various forms such as vector databases or KG [ 66].
Subsequently, in theOnline Retrievalphase, the system retrieves
relevant components (e.g., text chunks or subgraphs) based on
the user query 𝑞to inform the LLM’s generation. However, these
general workflows often treat the index as a structure derived purely
from content, potentially detaching it from the document’s original
logical hierarchy. In contrast, our approach seeks to deeply integrate
these retrieval structures with the document’s native tree topology.
4 BookIndex
This section introduces our proposedBookIndex, a hierarchical
structure-aware index designed to capture both the explicit logical
hierarchy and the intricate entity relations within complex doc-
uments. We first formally define the structure of the BookIndex
(𝐵). Subsequently, we elaborate on the sequential, two-stage con-
struction process: (1)Tree Construction, which parses the docu-
ment’s layout to establish a hierarchical nodes, each categorized
by type; and (2)Graph Construction, which extracts fine-grained
entity knowledge from the tree nodes and refines it through a novel
gradient-based entity resolution method.
4.1 Overview of BookIndex
We formally define ourBookIndexas a triplet 𝐵=(𝑇,𝐺,𝑀) . Here,
𝑇=(𝑁,𝐸 𝑇)represents aTreestructure where 𝑁is the set of nodes
derived from the document’s explicit logical hierarchy (e.g., titles,
sections, tables), and 𝐸𝑇denotes their nesting relationships. 𝐺=
(𝑉,𝐸𝐺)is aKnowledge Graphthat captures fine-grained entities ( 𝑉)
and their relations ( 𝐸𝐺) scattered throughout the document. Finally,
𝑀:𝑉→P(𝑁) is theGraph-Tree Link (GT-Link), which links each
entity in𝑉to the set of specific tree nodes in 𝑁from which it
was extracted. These links are crucial for capturing the intricate,
cross-sectional relations within the document. The hierarchical
tree nodes in 𝑇serve as the document’s nativeinformation patches,
providing structured contexts for information seeking. Meanwhile,
the entities and relations in 𝐺, connected via 𝑀, act as the rich

Filtering, and Graph Construction, which involves KG Construction and Gradient-based Entity Resolution.
information scentthat guides navigation between and within these
patches.
Figure 2 provides an example of our BookIndex. The Tree com-
ponent, positioned at the top, organizes the document into a hier-
archical structure, where content blocks such as text, tables, and
images serve as leaf nodes nested within section nodes. The Graph
component is composed of entities and relations extracted from
these nodes. The GT-Link, illustrated by the blue dotted lines, explic-
itly connects these entities back to their corresponding tree nodes,
thereby grounding the semantic entities within the document’s
logical hierarchy.
4.2 Tree Construction
The first stage transforms the raw document into a structured hier-
archical tree 𝑇. This involves two key steps: robust layout parsing
and intelligent section filtering.
4.2.1 Layout Parsing.The Layout Parsing phase processes the
input document 𝐷(a collection of pages) using layout analysis and
recognition models. This step identifies, extracts, and organizes
diverse blocks (e.g., text, tables, images) from the document pages.
The output is a sequence of primitive blocks, B={𝑏 1,𝑏2,···,𝑏𝑘},
where each block 𝑏𝑖=(𝑐𝑖,𝜏𝑖,𝑓𝑖)is defined as a triplet. Here, 𝑐𝑖is
the raw content (e.g., text, image data), 𝜏𝑖is the initial layout-based
type (e.g., Title, Text, Table, Image ), and𝑓𝑖is a vector of
associated layout features (e.g., “FontSize”, bounding box).
4.2.2 Section Filtering.Next, the Section Filtering phase processes
this initial sequence to identify the document’s logically hierarchical
structure. Layout Parsing identifies blocks as Title but does not
assign their hierarchical level. Therefore, we select the candidate
subsetBtitle⊂B (where𝜏𝑖=Title ) for an LLM-based analysis.
To handle extremely long documents, this analysis is performed in
batches, where each batch retains a contextual window of high-levelsection information (with 𝑙=1as the root). The LLM analyzes the
content𝑐𝑖and layout features 𝑓𝑖of the candidates to determine two
key properties: their actual hierarchical level 𝑙𝑖∈{1,2,...}and final
node type𝜏′
𝑖(e.g., re-classifying an erroneous Title asText if its
level is “None”). This step is crucial for preserving the document’s
logical hierarchy by correcting blocks erroneously parsed as Title ,
such as descriptive text within images or borderless table headers.
Finally, the definitive tree 𝑇=(𝑁,𝐸 𝑇)is constructed. The node
set𝑁is composed of all blocks from the filtering and re-classification
process, where each node 𝑛∈𝑁 retains its content ( 𝑐𝑖) and its final
node type (𝜏′
𝑖) (e.g., Text ,Section ,Table , and Image ). The edge
set𝐸𝑇, representing the parent-child nesting relationships, is then
established. Parent-child relationships are inferred by sequentially
traversing the nodes, using both the determined hierarchical levels
(𝑙𝑖) ofSection nodes and the overall document order to assemble
the complete tree structure.
As an example shown in Figure 2, theLayout Parsingphase
identifies diverse blocks, typing them as Title ,Text ,Table , and
Image . During theSection Filteringphase, the Title candidates (e.g.,
"Method", "Experiment", and "MOE Layer") are analyzed by the LLM.
The blocks “Method” and “Experiment” (both with “FontSize: 14”)
are correctly identified as Section nodes at “Level: 2”. Conversely,
the “MOE Layer” block (“FontSize: 20”), which was erroneously
tagged as Title by the parser, is re-classified by the LLM as a Text
node with “Level: None”. This correction is crucial for preserving
the document’s logical hierarchy. Following this process, all filtered
and classified nodes are assembled into the final tree structure based
on their determined levels and document order.
4.3 Graph Construction
Once the tree 𝑇is established, we proceed to populate the Knowl-
edge Graph 𝐺by extracting and refining entities from the tree
nodes.

14𝐺←MergeEntity(𝐺,𝑣 𝑛,𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙),𝐷𝐵←Update(𝐷𝐵,𝑣 𝑠𝑒𝑙,𝑣𝑛);
15return𝐺,𝐷𝐵;
4.3.1 KG Construction.We iterate each node 𝑛𝑖∈𝑁 from the
previously constructed tree 𝑇. For each node 𝑛𝑖, we extract a sub-
graph𝑔𝑖=(𝑉𝑖,𝐸𝑅𝑖)based on its content 𝑐𝑖and final node type 𝜏′
𝑖.
This extraction is modality-dependent: if the node is text-only, an
LLM is prompted to extract entities and relations, while for nodes
containing visual elements (e.g., 𝜏′
𝑖=Image ), a Vision Language
Model (VLM) is employed to extract visual knowledge. Crucially,
for every entity 𝑣∈𝑉𝑖extracted, its origin tree node 𝑛𝑖is recorded,
which is vital for constructing the final mapping𝑀.
Furthermore, to preserve structural semantics for specific logical
types (e.g., Table ,Formula ), our process first creates a distinct,
typed entity (e.g., 𝑣tablerepresenting the table itself). The other
extracted entities from the specific node’s content are linked to
this primary vertex. For Table nodes specifically, row and column
headers are also explicitly extracted as distinct entities and linked
to𝑣 tablevia a “ContainedIn” relationship.
4.3.2 Gradient-based Entity Resolution.As shown in the litera-
ture [ 62,66], a well-constructed KG is essential for document ques-
tion answering. A common challenge in the extraction process is
that the same conceptual entity is often fragmented into multiple
distinct entities due to abbreviations, co-references, or its varied
occurrences across different document sections. This necessitates a
robust Entity Resolution (ER) process, which identifies and merges
these fragmented entities to refine the raw KG.
However, conventional ER methods are computationally expen-
sive. They are often designed for batch processing across multiple
data sources (commonly referred to as dirty ER), aiming to en-
sure accurate entity resolution by finding all possible matching
pairs [ 12]. This process typically requires finding the transitive
closure of all detected matches. That is, to definitively merge mul-
tiple entities (e.g., A, B, and C) as the same concept, the system
must ideally compare all possible pairs (“A-B”, “A-C”, and “B-C”)
to confirm their equivalence. This can lead to a quadratic ( 𝑂(𝑛2))number of pairwise comparisons, a process that becomes prohibi-
tively slow and computationally expensive when relying on LLMs
for high-accuracy judgments.
To address this, we employ a gradient-based ER method, op-
erating on a single document (simplified as the clean ER), which
performs ER incrementally as each new entity 𝑣𝑛is extracted. This
transforms the quadratic batch problem into a simpler, repeated
lookup task: determining where the single new entity 𝑣𝑛fits among
the already-processed entities in the database. This incremental
process yields two distinct, observable scoring patterns when 𝑣𝑛is
reranked against its𝑡𝑜𝑝_𝑘most relevant candidates:
•Case A: New Entity.If 𝑣𝑛is a new conceptual entity, its rele-
vance scores against all existing entities will be uniformly
low, showing no significant gradient or discriminative pat-
tern.
•Case B: Existing Entity.If 𝑣𝑛is an alias of an existing entity,
its scores will show a high relevance to the true match (or a
small set of equivalent aliases). Due to the reranker’s inher-
ent discriminative limitations, this initial high-relevance set
might occasionally contain multiple similar entities. This
high-relevance set is then typically followed by asharp de-
cline(a large “gradient”) before transitioning to agradual
slopeof irrelevant entities.
Our Gradient-based ER algorithm is designed precisely to de-
tect this sharp decline (characteristic of Case B), allowing us to
efficiently isolate the high-relevance set. Subsequently, an LLM is
utilized for finer-grained distinction when multiple similar entities
are identified within this set, differentiating it from the “no gradient”
scenario (Case A) without quadratic comparisons.
Algorithm 1 shows the above entity resolution process. For a new
entity𝑣𝑛, we first retrieve its 𝑡𝑜𝑝_𝑘 candidates𝐸𝑐from the vector
database𝐷𝐵, which are then reranked by Ragainst𝑣𝑛and sorted
based on their scores S(Lines 1-3). We initialize the selection set
𝑆𝑒𝑙with the top-scoring candidate 𝐸𝑐[0]and set the initial score
toS[0](Line 4). We then iterate through the remaining sorted
candidates (Lines 5-8). The core logic checks if the current score
S[𝑣𝑐]is still within the gradient threshold 𝑔of the previous score
(i.e.,S[𝑣𝑐]>score/𝑔 ). If the score drop is gentle (passes the check),
the candidate 𝑣𝑐is added to𝑆𝑒𝑙, and score is updated (Lines 7-8);
otherwise, the loop breaks (Line 8) as soon as a sharp score drop is
detected. Finally, the algorithm makes its decision (Lines 9-14). If the
selection set 𝑆𝑒𝑙is identical to 𝐸𝑐, this indicates that all candidates
passed the gradient check. This corresponds toCase A, where the
scores lacked discriminative power (i.e., 𝑣𝑛is equally dissimilar to
all candidates), so 𝑣𝑛is added as a new entity (Line 9-10). Conversely,
if a gradient was found (i.e., 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑆𝑒𝑙)<𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝐸 𝑐)), this signals
Case B. We then select the canonical entity 𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙from𝑆𝑒𝑙, using an
LLM (Line 13) if the reranker identifies multiple aliases, and merge
𝑣𝑛with it (Lines 12-14). The updated 𝐺and𝐷𝐵are then returned
(Line 15).
For instance, considering the example in Figure 2, when the
new entity 𝑒9is processed, it is first compared with existing en-
tities in the KG. As depicted in the similarity curve (orange line),
𝑒9shows high similarity with 𝑒7, followed by a sharp decline in
similarity with other entities like 𝑒6,𝑒8, and𝑒5. Our gradient-based
selection process identifies 𝑒7as the unique, high-confidence match

for𝑒9. Consequently, 𝑒9is merged with 𝑒7, enriching the KG with
consolidated information as shown in the final merged entity𝑒′
7.
Graph-Tree Link (GT-Link).The GT-Link 𝑀is formalized to
complete the BookIndex 𝐵=(𝑇,𝐺,𝑀) . As described in theKG
Constructionphase, the origin tree node 𝑛𝑖is recorded for every
newly extracted entity 𝑣𝑖. GT-Link is then refined during entity
resolution: when an entity 𝑣𝑛is merged into a canonical entity 𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙,
the origin node set of 𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙is updated to include all origin nodes
previously associated with 𝑣𝑛. This aggregation process creates the
final mapping 𝑀:𝑉→P(𝑁) , which bi-directionally links the
entities in𝐺to the set of their structural locations (nodes) in𝑇.
5 Agent-based Retrieval
Real-world document queries are often complex, necessitating op-
erations like modal type filtering, semantic selection, and multi-hop
reasoning. To address this, we propose an agent-based approach
in BookRAG, which intelligently plans and executes operations on
the BookIndex. We first introduce the overall workflow and present
two core mechanisms:Agent-based Planning, which formulates
the strategy, and theStructured Execution, which includes the
retrieval process under the principles of IFT and generation.
5.1 Overall Workflow
The overall workflow of agent-based retrieval, illustrated in Figure 3,
follows a three-stage pipeline designed to address users’ queries
systematically.
1. Agent-based Planning.BookRAG first performsClassifica-
tion & Plan. This stage aims to distinguish simple keyword-based
queries from reasoning questions that require decomposition and
analysis. For instance, a query like “How does Transformer dif-
fer from RNNs in handling long-range dependencies?” cannot be
solved by retrieving from a single keyword. Therefore, the planning
stage first performsquery classification. Based on this classifica-
tion and a predefined set of operators designed for the BookIndex,
it generates a specificoperators planthat effectively guides the
retrieval and generation strategies.
2. Retrieval Process.Guided by the operator plan, the retrieval
process executesScent/Filter-based Retrieval. This stage navigates
the BookIndex 𝐵=(𝑇,𝐺,𝑀) , either utilizing ascent-based re-
trieval principle(e.g., following relevant entities in 𝐺) to find
information, or employing various filters (e.g., modal type) to refine
the selection. After reasoning, BookRAG gets the retrieval set of
highly relevant information blocks from the BookIndex.

BookRAG, which contains agent-based planning, retrieval,
and generation processes.
3. Generation Process.Finally, all retrieved information enters
the generation stage forAnalysis & Merging. This stage synthesizes
these (often fragmented) pieces of evidence, performs final analysis,
and formulates a coherent response.
5.2 Agent-based Planning
The planning stage is the core of BookRAG, designed to intelligently
navigate our BookIndex 𝐵=(𝑇,𝐺,𝑀) . To support flexible retrieval,
we define four types of operators: Formulator, Selector, Reasoner,
and Synthesizer. These operators can be arbitrarily combined to
form tailored execution pipelines, each with adjustable parameters.
BookRAG dynamically configures and assembles these operators
to adapt to the specific requirements of different query categories.
This process involves two sequential steps: first, the agent performs
Query Classificationto determine the appropriate solution strategy,
then generates a specificOperator Plan.
•Query Classification. To enable agent strategy selection, we
focus on three representative query categories defined by their
intrinsic complexity and operational demands (Table 2):Single-hop,
Multi-hop, andGlobal Aggregation. This classification is crucial
because each category requires a different solution strategy. For
instance, aSingle-hopquery typically requires a single piece of infor-
mation retrieved via aScent-based Retrievaloperation. In contrast,
aGlobal Aggregationquery often necessitates analyzing content
under multiple filtering conditions, usually involving a sequence

ofFilter & Aggregationoperations across various parts of the docu-
ment. Furthermore, BookRAG is designed to be extensible, allowing
for the resolution of a broader range of query types by integrating
additional operators.
•BookIndex Operators. To execute the strategies identified
by classification, we designed a set of operators ( O) tailored for
the BookIndex 𝐵=(𝑇,𝐺,𝑀) . These operators, visually depicted in
Figure 4(a) and detailed in Table 3, define the set of operations the
agent can employ for diverse query categories. We group them into
four types, which we describe in sequence:
❶Formulator.These are LLM-based operators that prepare the
query for execution. This category includes Decompose , which
breaks aComplexquery into a set of simpler, actionable sub-queries
𝑄𝑠. It also includes Extract , which employs an LLM to identify
key entities 𝐸𝑞from the query text and link them to corresponding
entities in the KG,𝐺:
𝑄𝑠=LLM(𝑃𝐷𝑒𝑐,𝑞)={𝑞 1,𝑞2,...,𝑞𝑘}(2)
𝐸𝑞=LLM(𝑃𝐸𝑥𝑡,𝑞)={𝑒 1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑚}(3)
Here,𝑞is the original user query, while 𝑃𝐷𝑒𝑐and𝑃𝐸𝑥𝑡represent
the prompts used to guide the LLM for the decomposition and
extraction tasks, respectively.
❷Selector.These operators filter or select specific content ranges
from the BookIndex. Filter_Modal and Filter_Range directly
apply the explicit constraints 𝐶(e.g., modal types, page ranges)
generated during the plan. Operating on theTree 𝑇=(𝑁,𝐸 𝑇),
these operators produce a filtered subset 𝑁𝑓where the predicate
𝐶(𝑛)holds true for each node:
𝑁𝑓={𝑛∈𝑁|𝐶(𝑛)}(4)In contrast, Select_by_Entity andSelect_by_Section target
contiguous document segments by retrieving subtrees rooted at
specific section nodes. This process first identifies a set of target
section nodes 𝑆target⊂𝑁 at a specified depth, where 𝑆target consists
of sections either linked to entities 𝐸𝑞via theGT-Link 𝑀or selected
by the LLM. It then retrieves all descendants of these targets to
form the selected node set𝑁 𝑠:
𝑁𝑠=Ø
𝑠∈𝑆 targetSubtree(𝑠)(5)
❸Reasoner.These operators analyze and refine selected tree nodes.
Graph_Reasoning performs multi-hop inference on a subgraph
𝐺′(𝑉′,𝐸′)(extracted from selected nodes 𝑁𝑠) starting from entity
𝑒. Starting from the retrieved entities, it computes an entity impor-
tance vector 𝐼𝐺∈R|𝑉′|over the subgraph 𝐺′using the PageRank
algorithm [ 20]. These entity scores are then mapped to the tree
nodes via the GT-Link matrix 𝑀to derive the final tree node im-
portance scores vector𝑆 𝐺∈R|𝑁𝑠|:
𝐼𝐺=PageRank(𝐺′,𝑒)(6)
𝑆𝐺=𝐼𝐺×𝑀(7)
Text_Ranker evaluates the semantic relevance of the tree node’s
content to the query 𝑞, assigning a relevance score 𝑆𝑇to each
node. Skyline_Ranker employs the Skyline operator to filter nodes
based on these multiple criteria (e.g., 𝑆𝐺and𝑆𝑇), retaining only
those nodes that are not dominated by any others in terms of the
specified scoring dimensions.
❹Synthesizer.These operators are responsible for content gen-
eration. Mapperforms analysis on specific retrieved information
segments to generate partial responses. Reduce synthesizes a final

Shu Wang, Yingli Zhou, and Yixiang Fang
coherent answer by aggregating information from multiple sources,
such as partial answers or a collection of retrieved evidence.
•Operator Plan. After classifying the query ( 𝑞) into its category
(𝑐), the agent’s final task is to generate an executable plan 𝑃. This
plan is a specific sequence of operators ⟨𝑜1,...,𝑜𝑛⟩selected from
our libraryOwith parameters dynamically instantiated based on 𝑞.
This process is formulated as:
𝑃=AgentPlan(𝑞,𝑐,O)(8)
The plan follows a structured workflow tailored to each category:
•Single-hop: The agent first attempts to Extract an entity. If
successful, it executes a “scent-based” selection; otherwise,
it falls back to a section-based strategy. Both paths then
proceed to standard reasoning and generation, denoted as
𝑃std.
𝑃s=(
Extractsuccess−−−−−→Select_by_Entity→𝑃 std
Extractfail−−→Select_by_Section→𝑃 std(9)
𝑃std=(Graph∥Text)→Skyline→Reduce(10)
•Complex: The agent first decomposes the problem, applies
the Single-hop workflow 𝑃sto each sub-problem, and finally
synthesizes the results.
𝑃complex =Decompose→𝑃 s→Map→Reduce(11)
•Global Aggregation: The workflow involves applying a se-
quence of filters followed by synthesis.
𝑃global =Ö
(Filter_Modal|Filter_Range)→Map→Reduce(12)
Here, the symbolÎdenotes the nested composition of
filters, applying either a modal or range filter at each step.
5.3 Structured Execution
Following the planning stage, BookRAG executes the generated
workflow𝑃. This execution phase embodies the cognitive prin-
ciples of Information Foraging Theory (IFT), effectively translat-
ing abstract textual queries into concrete operations. Specifically,theSelector operators mirror the act of “navigating to informa-
tion patches,” narrowing the vast document space down to rele-
vant scopes. Subsequently, the Reasoner operators perform “sense-
making within patches, ” where they analyze and refine the informa-
tion within these focused scopes. Finally, the Synthesizer gener-
ates the answer based on the processed evidence. This design mini-
mizes the cost of attention by ensuring computational resources
are focused solely on high-value data patches.
Scent/Filter-based Retrieval.The execution begins by narrowing
the scope. Aligning with IFT, Selector operators identify relevant
“patches” by following “information scents” (e.g., key entities in
question) or applying explicit filter constraints. This process reduces
the full node set𝑁to a focused node subset𝑁 𝑠:
𝑁𝑠=Selector(𝑁,paramssel)(13)
This pre-selection minimizes noise and ensures that subsequent
reasoning is applied only to highly relevant contexts, optimiz-
ing the foraging cost. Subsequently, within this focused scope,
Reasoner operators evaluate nodes using multiple dimensions,
such as graph topology and semantic relevance. We then employ
theSkyline_Ranker to get the final retrieval set. Unlike fixed top- 𝑘
retrieval, the Skyline operator retains thePareto frontierof nodes,
retaining nodes that are valuable in at least one dimension while
discarding dominated ones:
𝑁𝑅=Skyline_Ranker({𝑆 𝐺(𝑛),𝑆𝑇(𝑛)|𝑛∈𝑁 𝑠})(14)
Analysis & Merging Generation.In the final stage, the Synthesizer
operator generates the coherent answer by aggregating the refined
evidence:
𝐴=Synthesizer(𝑞,𝑁 𝑅)(15)
TheMapoperator performs fine-grained analysis on individual ev-
idence blocks or sub-problems (from Decompose ) to generate in-
termediate insights. The Reduce operator then aggregates these
partial results, such as answers to decomposed sub-queries or sta-
tistical counts from a global filter, to construct the final response.

This separation ensures that the system can handle both detailed
content extraction and high-level reasoning synthesis effectively.
To illustrate this end-to-end process, Figure 4(b) presents an
execution trace for a “Single-hop” query: “What is the type ofcar
in theRanking Promptexample?”. In the planning phase, the agent
classifies the query and generates a specific workflow. Subsequently,
it identifies key entities (e.g., “car”) via Extract , retrieves relevant
nodes via Select_by_Entity , refines them through reasoning and
Skyline filtering, and finally synthesizes the answer using Reduce .
6 Experiments
In our experiments, we evaluate BookRAG against several strong
baseline methods, with an in-depth comparison of their efficiency
and accuracy on document QA tasks.

Datasets & Question Synthesis.We use three widely adopted
benchmarking datasets for complex document QA tasks: MMLong-
Bench [ 33], M3DocVQA [ 11], and Qasper [ 14]. MMLongBench is
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate QA capabili-
ties on long-form documents, covering diverse categories such as
guidebooks, financial reports, and industry files. M3DocVQA is an
open-domain benchmark designed to test RAG systems on a di-
verse collection of HTML-type documents sourced from Wikipedia
pages1. Qasper is a QA dataset focused on scientific papers, where
questions require retrieving evidence from the entire document. We
filtered the datasets to remove documents with low clarity or inco-
herent structures. To address the scarcity of global-level questions
in the original benchmarks, we synthesize additional QA pairs by
having an LLM generate global questions from selected document
elements (e.g., tables or figures). These questions are then answered
and meticulously refined by human annotators via an outsourcing
process, with this additional QA pairs constituting less than 20% of
our final QA pairs. The statistics of these datasets are presented in
Table 4.
Metrics.We adhere to the official metrics specified by each dataset
for QA. Our primary evaluation relies on Exact Match (EM), ac-
curacy, and token-based F1-score. To assess efficiency, we also
measure time cost and token usage during the response phase. Ad-
ditionally, for methods including PDF parsing, we also evaluate
retrieval recall. To establish the ground truth for this, we manually
label the specific PDF blocks (e.g., texts, titles, tables, images, and
1https://www.wikipedia.org/formulas) required to answer each question. This labeling process is
guided by the metadata of ground-truth evidence provided in each
dataset; we filter candidate blocks using the given modality (all
datasets), page numbers (MMLongBench), and evidence statements
(Qasper). Any blocks that remained non-unique after this filtering
process are manually annotated. In cases where a PDF parsing error
made the ground-truth item unavailable, the retrieval recall for that
query is recorded as 0.
Baselines.Our experiments consider three model configurations:
•Conventional RAG:These methods are the most com-
mon pipeline for document analysis, where the raw text is
first extracted and then chunked into segments of a speci-
fied size. We select strong and widely used retrieval mod-
els: BM25 [ 44] and Vanilla RAG. We also implement Lay-
out+Vanilla, a variant that uses document layout analysis
for semantic chunking.
•Graph-based RAG:These methods first extract textual
content from documents and then leverage graph data dur-
ing retrieval. We select RAPTOR [ 45] and GraphRAG [ 16].
Specifically, GraphRAG has two versions: GraphRAG-Global
and GraphRAG-Local, which employ global and local search
methods, respectively.
•Layout segmented RAG:This category encompasses meth-
ods that utilize layout analysis to segment document con-
tent into discrete structural units. We include: MM-Vanilla,
which utilizes multi-modal embeddings for visual and tex-
tual content; a tree-based method inspired by PageIndex [ 39],
denoted as TreeTraverse, where an LLM navigates the docu-
ment’s tree structure; DocETL [ 47], a declarative system for
complex document processing; and GraphRanker, a graph-
based method extended from HippoRAG [ 19] that applies
Personalized PageRank [20] to rank the relevant nodes.
Implementation details.For a fair comparison, both BookRAG
and all baseline methods are powered by a unified set of state-of-the-
art (SOTA) and widely adopted backbone models from the Qwen
family [ 4,60,63,64]. We employ MinerU [ 52] for robust document
layout parsing. We set the threshold of gradient 𝑔as0.6, and more
details are provided in the appendix of our technical report [ 57].
Our source code, prompts, and detailed configurations are available
at github.com/sam234990/BookRAG.
6.2 Overall results
In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of BookRAG,
analyzing its complex QA performance, retrieval effectiveness, and
query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
•QA Performance of BookRAG. We compare the QA per-
formance of BookRAG against three categories of baselines, as
shown in Table 5. The results indicate that BookRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, substantially out-
performing the top-performing baseline by 18.0% in Exact Match
on M3DocVQA. Layout + Vanilla consistently outperforms Vanilla
RAG, confirming that layout parsing preserves essential structural
information for better retrieval. Besides, the suboptimal results of
Tree-Traverse and GraphRanker highlight the limitations of relying
solely on hierarchical navigation or graph-based reasoning, which

often miss cross-sectional context or drift into irrelevant scopes.
In contrast, BookRAG’s superiority stems from the synergy of its
unified Tree-Graph BookIndex and Agent-based Planning. By ef-
fectively classifying queries and configuring optimal workflows,
our BookRAG overcomes limitations of context fragmentation and
static query workflow within existing baselines, ensuring precise
evidence retrieval and accurate generation.

•Retrieval performance of BookRAG.To validate our re-
trieval design, we evaluate the retrieval recall of BookRAG against
other layout-based baselines on the ground-truth layout blocks. The
experimental results demonstrate that BookRAG achieves the high-
est recall across all datasets, notably reaching 71.2% on M3DocVQA
and significantly outperforming the next best baseline (GraphRanker,
max 44.5%). This performance advantage stems from our IFT-inspired
Selector→Reasonerworkflow: the Agent-based Planning first
classifies the query, enabling the Selector to narrow the search to
a preciseinformation patch, followed by the Reasoner’s analysis.
Crucially, after the Skyline_Ranker process, the average number
of retained nodes is 9.87, 6.86, and 8.6 across the three datasets,
which is comparable to the standard top- 𝑘(𝑘=10) setting, ensuring
high-quality retrieval without inflating the candidate size.
•Efficiency of BookRAG.We further evaluate the efficiency in
terms of query time and token consumption, as illustrated in Figure
5. Overall, BookRAG maintains time and token costs comparable
to existing Graph-based RAG methods. While purely text-basedBM25 Vanilla RAG Layout + Vanilla

RAG approaches generally exhibit lower latency and token usage
due to the absence of VLM processing for images, BookRAG main-
tains a balanced efficiency among multi-modal methods. In terms
of token usage, BookRAG reduces consumption by an order of
magnitude compared to the strongest baseline, DocETL. Notably,
on the MMLongBench dataset, DocETL consumes over 53 million
tokens, whereas BookRAG requires less than 5 million. Regarding
the query latency, our method also achieves a speedup of up to2 ×
compared to DocETL.

6.3 Detailed Analysis
In this section, we provide a more in-depth examination of our
BookRAG. We first conduct an ablation study to validate the con-
tribution of each component, followed by an experiment on the
impact of gradient-based ER and QA performance across different
query types. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive error anal-
ysis, compare the effectiveness of our entity resolution method, and
present a case study.
•Ablation study.To evaluate the contribution of each core
component in BookRAG, we design several variants by removing
specific components:
•w/o Gradient ER: Replaces the gradient-based entity reso-
lution with a Basic ER by merging the same-name entities.
•w/o Planning: Removes the Agent-based Planning, default-
ing to a static, standard workflow for all queries.
•w/o Selector : Removes the Selector operators, forcing
Reasoners to score all candidate nodes.
•w/oGraph_Reasoning : Removes the Graph_Reasoning op-
erator. Consequently, the Skyline_Ranker is also disabled
as scoring becomes single-dimensional.
•w/o Text_Reasoning : Removes the Text_Reasoning op-
erator. Similarly, the Skyline_Ranker is disabled, relying
solely on graph-based scores.

of BookRAG. EM and F1 denote Exact Match and F1-score,

The first variant evaluates the impact of KG quality on retrieval
performance. The second and third variants assess the necessity of
our Agent-based Planning and IFT-inspired selection mechanism,
respectively. Finally, the last two variants validate the effectiveness
of our multi-dimensional reasoning and dynamic Skyline filtering
strategy. As shown in Table 7, the performance degradation across
all variants confirms the essential role of each module in BookRAG.
Specifically, the performance drop in thew/o Gradient ERvariant
highlights the critical role of a high-quality, connectivity-rich KG in
supporting effective reasoning. Removing thePlanningmechanism
results in the most significant performance loss, confirming that a
static workflow is insufficient for handling diverse types of queries.
Thew/o Selectorvariant, while maintaining competitive accuracy,
incurs a prohibitive computational cost ( >2×tokens on Qasper),
validating the efficiency of our IFT-inspired "narrow-then-reason"
strategy.
•Impact of Gradient-based Entity Resolution.To evaluate
the quality of our constructed KG, we compare the graph statisticsBasic Gradient-based ER

of our Gradient-based ER against a Basic KG construction. The Ba-
sic setting employs simple exact name matching for entity merging,
which is standard practice in many graph-based methods. Figure 6
presents the comparative results, normalizing the metrics (Entity
count, Density, Diameter of the Largest Connected Component,
and Number of Connected Components) against the Basic baseline.
The results demonstrate that our Gradient-based ER significantly
optimizes KG. Specifically, it reduces the number of entities (by
12%) while substantially boosting graph density (by over 20% across
datasets). This structural shift indicates that our ER module effec-
tively identifies the same conceptual entities that possess different
names. Consequently, the resulting graphs are more compact and
cohesive, as evidenced by the reduced diameter and fewer connected
components, which mitigates graph fragmentation and facilitates
better connectivity for graph reasoning.

•QA performance under different query types.Figure 7
breaks down the performance of BookRAG across Single-hop, Multi-
hop, and Global aggregation query types. We observe that Multi-
hop queries generally present a greater challenge compared to
Single-hop ones, resulting in a slight performance decrease. This
trend reflects the inherent difficulty of retrieving and reasoning
over disjoint pieces of evidence. It further validates our agent-based
planning strategy, which handles different query types separately.
•Error Response analysis.To diagnose the performance bot-
tlenecks of BookRAG, we conduct a fine-grained error analysis on
200 sampled queries from each dataset, tracing the error propaga-
tion as shown in Figure 9. We categorize failures into four types:
PDF Parsing, Plan, Retrieval, and Generation errors. The results

identify Retrieval Error as the dominant failure mode, followed by
Generation Error, reflecting the persistent challenge of locating
and synthesizing multimodal evidence. Regarding Plan Error, our
qualitative analysis reveals a specific failure pattern: the planner
tends to over-decompose detailed single-hop queries into unnec-
essary multi-hop sub-tasks. This fragmentation leads to disjointed
retrieval paths, effectively preventing the model from synthesizing
a cohesive final answer from the scattered sub-responses.
•Case study.Figure 8 illustrates BookRAG’s answering work-
flow across Single-hop, Multi-hop, and Global queries. The re-
sults demonstrate that by leveraging specific operators ( Select ,
Decompose , and Filter ), BookRAG effectively prunes search spaces.
For example, in the Single-hop case, the reasoning space is signif-
icantly reduced from 134 to 24 nodes. This capability allows the
system to efficiently isolate relevant evidence from noise, ensuring
precise answer generation.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose BookRAG, a novel method built upon Book
Index, a document-native, structured Tree-Graph index specifically
designed to capture the intricate relations of structural documents.
By employing an agent-based method to dynamically configure

BookRAG: A Hierarchical Structure-aware Index-based Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Complex Documents
retrieval and reasoning operators, our approach achieves state-of-
the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating signif-
icant superiority over existing baselines in both retrieval precision
and answer accuracy. In the future, we will explore an integrated
document-native database system that supports data formatting,
knowledge extraction, and intelligent querying.

A Experimental details
A.1 Evaluation Metrics
In this section, we provide the detailed definitions and calculation
procedures for the metrics used in our main experiments.
A.1.1 Answer Extraction and Normalization.Standard RAG models
typically generate free-form natural language responses, which
may contain extraneous conversational text (e.g., “The answer is... ”).
Directly comparing these raw outputs with concise ground truth
labels (e.g., “Option A” or “12.5”) can lead to false negatives.
Following official evaluation protocols, we employ an LLM-based
extraction step to align the model output with the ground truth for-
mat before calculation. Let 𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑤denote the raw response generated
by the RAG system and 𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑denote the ground truth. We define
the extracted answer ˆ𝑦as:
ˆ𝑦=LLM extract(𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑤,Instruction)(16)
where LLM extract extracts the key information (e.g., the key entity
for span extraction) from 𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑤. We further apply standard normal-
izationN(·) (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation) to both ˆ𝑦
and𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑.
A.1.2 QA Performance Metrics.Based on the ground truth 𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑
and the model’s response (either raw 𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑤or extracted ˆ𝑦), we com-
pute the following metrics:
Accuracy (Inclusion-based).Following prior works [ 3,34,46], we
utilize accuracy as a soft-match metric. We consider a prediction
correct if the normalized gold answer is included in the model’s
generated response, rather than requiring a strict exact match. This
accounts for the uncontrollable nature of LLM generation.
Accuracy=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1I(N(𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑,𝑖)⊆N(𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑤,𝑖))(17)
where⊆denotes the substring inclusion relation.
Exact Match (EM)..Unlike accuracy, Exact Match is a strict metric.
It measures whether the normalizedextractedanswer ˆ𝑦is character-
for-character identical to the ground truth.
EM=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1I(N( ˆ𝑦𝑖)=N(𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑,𝑖))(18)
F1-score.For questions requiring text span answers, we utilize
the token-level F1-score between the extracted answer ˆ𝑦and the
ground truth𝑦 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑. Treating them as bags of tokens𝑇 ˆ𝑦and𝑇𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑:
𝑃=|𝑇ˆ𝑦∩𝑇𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑|
|𝑇ˆ𝑦|, 𝑅=|𝑇ˆ𝑦∩𝑇𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑|
|𝑇𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑|,F1=2·𝑃·𝑅
𝑃+𝑅(19)A.1.3 Retrieval Recall.As described in the main text, we evaluate
retrieval quality based on the granularity of parsed PDF blocks (e.g.,
paragraphs, tables, images). For a given query 𝑞, letB𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑be the
set of manually labeled ground-truth blocks required to answer 𝑞,
andB𝑟𝑒𝑡be the set of unique blocks retrieved by the system. The
Retrieval Recall is defined as:
Recall𝑟𝑒𝑡=(
0if parsing error occurs onB 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑
|B𝑟𝑒𝑡∩B𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑|
|B𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑|otherwise(20)
Specifically, if a ground-truth block is lost due to PDF parsing
failures (i.e., it does not exist in the candidate pool), it is considered
strictly unretrievable, resulting in a recall contribution of 0 for that
specific block.
A.2 Implementation details
We implement BookRAG in Python, utilizing MinerU [ 52] for robust
document layout parsing. For a fair comparison, both BookRAG and
all baseline methods are powered by a unified set of state-of-the-
art (SOTA) and widely adopted backbone models from the Qwen
family [ 4,60,63,64], including LLM, vision-language model (VLM),
and embedding models. Specifically, we utilize Qwen3-8B [ 60]
as the default LLM, Qwen2.5VL-30B [ 4] as the vision-language
model (VLM), Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B [ 64] for text embedding,
gme-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct [ 63] for multi-modal embedding, and
Qwen3-Reranker-4B [ 64] for reranking. We primarily select models
under the 10B parameter scale to balance efficiency and effective-
ness. However, for the VLM, we adopt the 30B version, as the 8B
counterpart exhibited significant performance deficits, frequently
failing to answer correctly even when provided with ground-truth
images. All experiments were conducted on a Linux operating sys-
tem running on a high-performance server equipped with an Intel
Xeon 2.0GHz CPU, 1024GB of memory, and 8 NVIDIA GeForce RTX
A5000 GPUs, each with 24 GB of VRAM. Specifically, to ensure a fair
comparison of efficiency, all methods were executed serially, and
the reported time costs reflect this sequential processing mode. For
methods involving document chunking and retrieval ranking, we
standardize the chunk size at 500 tokens and set the retrieval top- 𝑘
to 10 to ensure consistent candidate pool sizes across baselines.
For further reproducibility, our source code and detailed imple-
mentation configurations are publicly available at our repository:
https://github.com/sam234990/BookRAG.
A.3 Prompts
Specifically, we present the prompts designed for agent-based query
classification (Figure 10), question decomposition (Figure 11), and
filter operator generation (Figure 12). Additionally, we illustrate
the prompt employed for entity resolution judgment (Figure 13)
during the graph construction phase.

BookRAG: A Hierarchical Structure-aware Index-based Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Complex Documents
You are an expert query analyzer. Your only task is to classify the user's question into one of three categories: "simple",
"complex", or "global". Respond only with the specified JSON object.
Category Definitions:
1. single-hop: The question can be fully answered by retrieving information from a SINGLE, contiguous location in the
document (e.g., one specific paragraph, one complete table, or one figure).
- This includes questions that require reasoning or comparison, as long as all the necessary data is present within
that single retrieved location.
- Example: "What is the title of Figure 2?"
- Example: "How do 5% of the Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children?" -> This is SIMPLE because the
answer can be found by looking at a single chart or paragraph.
2. multi-hop: The question requires decomposition into multiple simple sub-questions, where each sub-question must be
answered by a separate retrieval action.
- It often contains a nested or indirect constraint that requires a preliminary step to resolve before the main
question can be answered.
- Example: "What is the color of the personality vector...?" -> This is COMPLEX because it requires two separate
retrieval actions.
3. global: The question requires an aggregation operation (e.g., counting, listing, summarizing) over a set of items that
are identified by a clear structural filter.
- Example: "How many tables are in the document?" -> This is GLOBAL because the process is to filter for all items of
type'table'.
User Query:query
Figure 10: The prompt for query classification.

Shu Wang, Yingli Zhou, and Yixiang Fang
You are a query decomposition expert. You have been given a "complex" question. Your task is to break it down into a series
of simple, atomic sub-questions and classify each one by type.
**Crucial Instructions:**
1. Each`retrieval`sub-question MUST be a direct information retrieval task that can be answered independently by looking
up a specific fact, number, or value in the document.
2. **`retrieval`sub-questions MUST NOT depend on the answer of another sub-question.** They should be parallelizable. All
logic for combining their results must be placed in a final`synthesis`question.
3. A`synthesis`question requires comparing, calculating, or combining the answers of the previous`retrieval`questions.
It does **NOT** require a new lookup in the document.
You MUST provide your response in a JSON object with a single key'sub_questions', which contains a list of objects. Each
object must have a'question'(string) and a'type'(string: "retrieval" or "synthesis").
--- EXAMPLE 1 (Correct Decomposition with Independent Lookups) ---
Complex Query: "What is the color of the personality vector in the soft-labled personality embedding matrix that with the
highest Receptiviti score for User A2GBIFL43U1LKJ?"
Expected JSON Output:
{{
"sub_questions": [
{{"question": "What are all the Receptiviti scores for each personality vector for User A2GBIFL43U1LKJ?",
"type": "retrieval"}},
{{"question": "What is the mapping of personality vectors to their colors in the soft-labled personality embedding
matrix?",
"type": "retrieval"}},
{{"question": "From the gathered scores, identify the personality vector with the highest score, and then find its
corresponding color from the vector-to-color mapping.",
"type": "synthesis"}}
]
}}
--- END EXAMPLE 1 ---
--- EXAMPLE 2 (Decomposition with retrieval and synthesis steps) ---
Complex Query: "According to the report, which one is greater in population in the survey? Foreign born Latinos, or the
Latinos interviewed by cellphone?"
Expected JSON Output:
{{
"sub_questions": [

BookRAG: A Hierarchical Structure-aware Index-based Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Complex Documents
You are a highly specialized AI assistant. Your only function is to analyze a "Global Query" and return a single, valid
JSON object that specifies both the filtering steps and the final aggregation operation. You MUST NOT output any other
text or explanation.
### INSTRUCTIONS \& DEFINITIONS ###
1. **Filters**: You MUST determine the list of`filters`to apply. Even if the filter is for the whole document (e.g., all
tables), the`filters`list must be present.
-`filter_type`: One of ["section", "image", "table", "page"].
-`section`: Use for structural parts like chapters, sections, appendices, or references.
-`image`: Use for visual elements like figures, images, pictures, or plots.
-`table`: Use for tabular data.
-`page`: Use for specific page numbers or ranges.
-`filter_value`: (Optional) Can be provided for "section" (e.g., a section title) or "page" (e.g.,'3-10'or'5').
**For "image" or "table", this value MUST be null.**
2. **Operation**: Determine the final aggregation operation.
-`operation`: One of ["COUNT", "LIST", "SUMMARIZE", "ANALYZE"].
### EXAMPLES OF YOUR TASK ###
User: "How many figures are in this paper from Page 3 to Page 10?"
Assistant: {{"filters": [{{"filter_type": "page", "filter_value": "3-10"}}, {{"filter_type": "image"}}], "operation":
"COUNT"}}
User: "Summarize the discussion about'data augmentation'in the'Methodology'section."
Assistant: {{"filters": [{{"filter_type": "section", "filter_value": "Methodology"}}], "operation": "SUMMARIZE"}}
User: "How many chapters are in this report?"
Assistant: {{"filters": [{{"filter_type": "section"}}], "operation": "COUNT"}}

-Goal-
You are an expert Entity Resolution Adjudicator. Your task is to determine if a "New Entity" refers to the exact same
real-world concept as one of the "Candidate Entities" provided from a knowledge graph. Your output must be a JSON
object containing the ID of the matching candidate (or -1) and a brief explanation for your decision.
-Context-
You will be given one "New Entity" recently extracted from a text. You will also be given a list of "Candidate Entities"
that are semantically similar, retrieved from an existing knowledge base. Each candidate has a unique`id`for you to
reference.
---
-Core Task & Rules-
1. **Analyze the "New Entity"**: Carefully read its name, type, and description to understand what it is.
2. **Field-by-Field Adjudication**: To determine a match, you must evaluate each field with a specific focus:
* **`entity_name`(High Importance):** The names must be extremely similar, a direct abbreviation (e.g., "LLM" vs.
"Large Language Model"), or a well-known alias. **If the names represent distinct, parallel concepts (like "Event
Detection" and "Named Entity Recognition"), they are NOT a match, even if their descriptions are very similar.**
* **`entity_type`(Medium Importance):** The types do not need to be identical, but they must be closely related and
compatible (e.g.,`COMPANY`and`ORGANIZATION`could describe the same entity).
* **`description`(Contextual Importance):** The descriptions may differ as they are often extracted from different
parts of a document. Your task is to look past surface-level text similarity and determine if they fundamentally
describe the **same underlying object or concept**.
3. **Be Strict and Conservative**: Your standard for a match must be very high. An incorrect merge can corrupt the
knowledge graph. A missed merge is less harmful.
* Surface-level similarities are not enough. The underlying concepts must be identical.
* For example, "Apple" (the fruit) and "Apple Inc." (the company) are NOT a match.
* **When in doubt, you MUST output -1.**
* **Assume No Match by Default**: In a large knowledge graph, most new entities are genuinely new. You should start
with the assumption that the "New Entity" is unique. You must find **strong, convincing evidence** across all
fields, especially the`entity_name`, to overturn this assumption and declare a match.
4. **Format the Output**: **You must provide your answer in a valid JSON format. The JSON object should contain two keys:**
*`select_id`: An integer. The`id`of the candidate you've determined to be an exact match. If no exact match is
found, this value MUST be`-1`.
*`explanation`: A brief, one-sentence string explaining your reasoning. For a match, explain why they are the same
entity. For no match, explain the key difference.
---
-Output Schema & Format-
Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that adheres to the following schema. Do not include any other text,
explanation, or markdown formatting like```json.
```json
{{
"select_id": "integer",
"explanation": "string"
}}
```

-Example-
### Example 1: Match Found
### Example 2: No Match Found

-Task Execution-
Now, perform the selection task based on the following data. Remember to output only a single integer.
