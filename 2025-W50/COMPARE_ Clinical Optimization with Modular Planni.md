## Abstract
Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

Abstract  
Background  While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography 
(OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation 
is operator -dependent . General -purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but 
lacks domain -specific reli ability. We evaluated the performance of CA -GPT-a novel 
large model deployed on an AI -OCT system -against that of the  general -purpose 
ChatGPT -5 and junior physicians for OCT -guided PCI planning and assessment . 
 
Methods  In this single -center  analysis  of 96 patients (160 lesions) who underwent 
OCT -guided PCI , the procedural decisions generated by the CA -GPT, ChatGPT -5, and 
junior physicians were compared against an expert -derived procedural record . 
Agreement was assessed using ten pre -specified metrics across pre -PCI (5 metrics) and 
post-PCI (5 metrics) phases, generating a total score from 0 to 5.  
 
Results  For pre -PCI planning, CA -GPT demonstrated significantly higher median 
agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75 -5]) compared to both ChatGPT -5 (3[2 -4], P<0.001) and 
junior physicians (4[3 -4], P<0.001). CA -GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT -5 
across all individual p re-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior 
physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 
52.8%, P<0.01). In post -PCI assessment, CA -GPT maintained excellent overall 
agreement (5[4.75 -5]), which was sig nificantly higher than both ChatGPT -5 (4[4 -5], 
P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4 -5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA -
GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios, including functionally 
significant lesions (OCT -FFR≤0.80) and acute coro nary syndrome presentations . 
 
Conclusion  The CA-GPT-based AI -OCT system  achieved superior decision -making 
agreement versus a general -purpose large language model and junior physicians across 
both PCI planning and assessment phases. By integrating automated OCT analysis with 
a curated knowledge base, this approach provides a s tandardized and reliable method

Clinical decision -making   

Introduction  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality and disability -
adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, accounting for approximately 19.2 million deaths 
and 437 million DALYs annually, with coronary artery disease  (CAD)  as the major 
contributor.1 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed in more than 4 
million patients worldwide each year, representing a cornerstone of revascularization 
therapy.2 Evidence has established that imaging -guided PCI, particularly using optical 
cohere nce tomography (OCT), can effectively reduce cardiovascular risks by 
optimizing stent implantation.3-5 However, the full potential of OCT is often limited by 
its significant dependence on operator interpretation.  Substantial  Inter-observer 
variability in classifying calcium severity and thin -capped fibroatheroma (TCFA) has 
been reported, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) as low as 0.55 -0.61, 
particularly among less experienced physicians.6  
 
In clinical practice -particularly in regions with uneven healthcare resource distribution -
OCT interpretation skills may vary considerably.7 Due to disparities in economic 
development, limited availability of structured imaging training, and high clinical 
workload, many interventional cardiologists in China face a slower learning curve in 
OCT interpretation.8-11 This skill gap may lead to inconsistent treatment quality and 
prevent some patients from receiving optimal lesion assessment and stent 
deployment.12 Addressing this gap requires new tools capable of assisting physicians in 
real-time OCT interpretation and PCI decision -making. 
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising adjunct in cardiovascular 
imaging13,14. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT -
5 represent general -purpose systems trained on internet -scale corpora. However, their 
clinical applicability remains questionable. Published studies have shown that 
generative pre-trained transformer  (GPT ) models can achieve 60 -85% accuracy on 
standardized medical licensing examinations but only 56% on general medical queries, 
which suggest s that while ChatGPT shows promise, its current capabilities remain 
inadequate for standalone clinical decision -making.15-17 This limitation is particularly 
pronounced in specialized domains like imaging -guided clinical tasks, where LLMs 
remain prone to hallucinations and factually unsupported outputs.14,17 Retrieval -
augmented generation (RAG) has been introduced as a strategy to mitigate 
hallucination by grounding model outputs in validated evidence sources. Integrating 
LLMs with RAG and structured imaging analysis therefore offers an opportunity to 
enhance accuracy and standardization in OCT interpretation.18-20 
 
With recent progress in domain -specific cardiovascular mo dels,21-23 we developed an 
integrated AI -OCT system powered by the CA -GPT large  model . This system is 
designed to provide end -to-end procedural support for PCI, where th e CA -GPT 
functions as the central decision engine, nesting automated OCT image analysis within 
a RAG framework for clinical reasoning . To validate its clinical utility, we conducted a 

retrospective study evaluating the diagnostic agreement of the CA-GPT, a general LLM, 
and junior interventionalists compared with expert operators in OCT -guided PCI .  
Methods  
Study Design and Population  
This analysis was conducted at Tangdu Hospital of Fourth Military Medical University . 
We included  consecutive patients who underwent OCT -guided PCI between June 2024 
and August 2025. Eligible cases wer e required to meet follow criteria: (i) Age between 
18 and 85 years ; (ii) complete OCT imaging of the target lesion, with adequate blood 
clearance and minimal motion artifacts to ensure valid analysis; and (iii) comprehensive 
procedural records documenting lesion assessment, pretreatment device type and size, 
stent diamete r and length, and post -PCI optimization strategies. Exclusion criteria 
included chronic total occlusion lesions, bifurcation lesions requiring two -stent 
techniques, inability to advance the OCT catheter, thrombus burden precluding imaging, 
poor-quality OCT  images, and incomplete procedural records lacking critical 
information. The study was approved by the medical ethics committee and was 
conducted in accordance with the the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable 
guidelines.24 Informed consent was waived for this analysis of anonymized clinical data.  
 
Decision -Making Systems and Comparators  
The AI -OCT system was developed by integrating the CA -GPT large model (developed 
by the Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen) with the OCT hardware 
(P80) provided by Vivolight Medtech (China) . This s ystem drives AI -powered OCT 
analysis and constitutes a domain -specific platform that integrates a  "small - and large -
model" framework to provide end -to-end procedural support for PCI. The small model 
layer conducts structured OCT analysis, performing 13 core functions -including lumen 
segmentation, plaque characterization, stent apposition assessment, a nd OCT -fractional 
flow reserve (FFR)  computation -six of which are proprietary algorithms. The large 
model layer is built upon the open -source DeepSeek -R1 (a 14B parameter model 
released in November 2023, with a knowledge cutoff of October 2023; inference 
temperature=0.7, repetition penalty=1.1). The system employs RAG, a technique that 
allows LLMs to access guideline content during response generation, improving 
accuracy when answering questions based on the guidelines.25 RAG integrates 
analytical outputs with a knowledge base of current guidelines and o ver 100,000 
annotated PCI cases . This integration facilitates a "retrieve -reason -generate" cycle, 
producing structured, evidence -traceable recommendations for all PCI stages ( Figure 
1). 
 
ChatGPT -5 (developed by OpenAI and officially released on August 7, 2025) served as 
a general -purpose AI comparator. For each case, key OCT parameters were manually 
extracted and entered into  the model with prompts restricting its role to that of a “senior 
interventional cardiologist.” The model was required to generate concise (< 40 words) 
recommendations covering revascularization, pretreatment, stent selection, and 

optimization ( Figure S1 ). Junior physicians were interventional cardiologists with 1 -5 
years of PCI experience who independently reviewed complete OCT images and 
provided decisions without access to expert or AI outputs. The reference standard was 
based on the actual procedural records from high -volume senior operators and was 
adjudicated by two independent senior experts (≥10 years of PCI experience, ≥200 
annual cases) using predefined scoring criteria ( Table S1 ).26,27 Each decision was 
independently score d by both experts, with any discrepancies resolved by a third senior 
expert to achieve final consensus.  
 
Data Processing and Input  
Data processing followed a standardized workflow. For the CA -GPT-based AI -OCT 
system , raw OCT images were directly uploaded, allowing the CA -GPT large model  to 
automatically drive the analysis pipeline  for generation of quantitative parameters and 
recommendations.  For ChatGPT -5, parameters were manually extracted for input, 
including pre -PCI (m inimum lumen area [MLA], OCT -FFR, maximum index of plaque 
attenuation within 4 mm [Max IPA 4mm], calcium score, calcium volume, distal and 
proximal reference diameters, lesion length) and post -PCI (minimum stent area [MSA], 
stent expansion, apposition, dissections, tissue prolapse) variables. Junior physicians 
independent ly interpreted complete OCT pullbacks and formulated their own strategies. 
All outputs were subsequently compared against the actual procedural records.  
 
Evaluation criteria  
Ten predefined decision metrics were used to quantify agreement across pre -PCI and 
post-PCI phases: (1) revascularization judgment; (2) pretreatment strategy; (3) 
pretreatment device size (±0.5 mm tolerance); (4) stent diameter (±0.5 mm tolerance); 
(5) ste nt length (±5 mm tolerance); (6) MSA adequacy (threshold 4.5 mm²); (7) stent 
expansion (≤80% considered under expanded); (8) stent apposition (severe 
malapposition defined as>400 μm or≥1mm length); (9) severe edge dissection (arc ≥60° 
and length≥3mm); and (10) severe tissue prolapse (≥10% of stent area) ( Table S1 ). The 
decision metrics were based on the Chinese Expert Consensus on the Application of 
OCT in Coronary Artery Disease and the Expert Consensus on Intravascular Imaging 
in PCI.26,27 Given that not all patients underwent both pre - and post -PCI OCT imaging, 
the ten predefined decision metrics were separately scored for the pre -PCI (5 metrics) 
and post -PCI (5 metrics) phases. Each metric was assigned 1 point if consistent with 
the actual  procedural records and 0 otherwise, yielding a total agreement score rangin g 
from 0 to 5. The primary endpoint was this total agreement score for each comparator 
against the actual procedural records. Secondary endpoints included agreement on 
individual metrics and the identification of influencing factors.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.5.1  (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation or median (interquartile range), and categorical variables were reported as 
counts (n) with percentages. The normality of continuous  variables was assessed using 

the Shapiro -Wilk test. The total agreement scores (range: 0 -5) among CA-GPT, 
ChatGPT -5, and junior physicians were compared using repeated measures ANOV A 
(parametric) or the Friedman test (non -parametric), with post -hoc pairwise comparisons 
conducted using paired t -tests or Wilcoxon signed -rank tests,  as appropriate. For each 
individual question, the compliance rates were compared using Cochran's Q test, 
followed by pairwise McNemar tests. The Bonferroni method was applied to control 
the family -wise error r ate at α = 0.05 for all multiple comparisons. Subgroup analyses 
were performed according to vessel location ( left anterior descending artery  [LAD ] vs. 
left circumflex /right coronary artery  [LCx/RCA ]), pre -PCI OCT -FFR (≤0.80 vs. >0.80), 
clinical presentation (ACS vs . SCAD) and calcium severity (Calcium score<4 vs. =4). 
Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  
Results  
Study Population and Baseline Characteristics  
From a consecutive cohort of 156 patients who underwent OCT -guided PCI, a total of 
96 patients with 160 lesions met the study criteria and were included in the final analysis 
(Figure S2 ). The baseline clinical and lesion characteristics are summarized in Table 
1. The study population had a mean age of 60.2±10.9 years, with 68.8% being male. 
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) accounted for 82.8% of presentations, with unstable 
angina being the most common diagnosis (60.2%) . The final PCI strategies comprised 
DES implantation (80.2%), DCB angioplasty (13.5%), or no immediate PCI (6.3%) . 
 
The OCT imaging analysis showed that the lesions were predominantly located in the 
LAD (60.6%), with a mean lesion length of 33.02±13.67 mm ( Table 1). The mean MLA 
was 3.94±2.42 mm², indicating significant anatomical severity, which was corroborated 
by a functionally impaired mean pre -PCI OCT -FFR of 0.74±0.08. The majority of 
lesions (87.5%) exhibited mild calcification (Calcium score<4). Post -PCI, th e mean 
MSA was 5.54±1.88 mm² with a mean stent expansion of 70.0±14.34%, and the 
functional significance of the stented lesion was resolved, as evidenced by a 
significantly improved mean post -PCI OCT -FFR of 0.89±0.06. The operator 
characteristics are detailed in Table S2. The PCI strategies for comparison were 
generated by four junior physicians (all with ≤5 years of experience), while the 
reference standard was derived from procedures performed by a separate group of 
senior operators, the majority of whom (85.7%) had ≥10  years of PCI experience and 
held senior academic titles.  
 
CA-GPT  Demonstrates Superior Decision Agreement in Pre -PCI Planning  
In pre -PCI decision -making, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher overall 
agreement scores compared to both ChatGPT -5 and junior physicians (median: 5[IQR 
3.75-5] vs . 3[2-4] vs . 4[3-4], respectively; P<0.001 ) for all pairwise comparisons  
(Table 2, Figure 2 ). This superiority was consistent across most individual metrics 
(Table 2, Figure S3). Specifically, CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT -5 in 
pretreatment device type selection (73.6% vs . 37.5%, P<0.001), device sizing (70.8% 

vs. 40.3%, P<0.001), stent diameter selection (90.3% vs . 63.9%, P<0.001), and stent 
length selection (80.6% vs . 54.2%, P<0.001). Compared to junior physicians, CA-GPT 
showed superior performance in stent diameter (90.3% vs . 72.2%, P<0.05) and length 
selection (80.6% vs . 52.8%, P<0.01).  
 
CA-GPT Outperforms Comparators in Post -Procedural Assessment  
In post -PCI assessment, the overall agreement of CA -GPT (median score: 5 [4.75 -5]) 
was significantly higher than that of ChatGPT -5 (4[4 -5], P<0.001) and junior physicians 
(5[4-5], P<0.05) ( Table 2, Figure 2, Figure S3 ). Analysis of individual endpoints 
revealed a distinct performance profile. All three groups achieved high agreement on 
MSA assessment (CA -GPT: 100%, ChatGPT -5: 100%, Junior physicians: 95.5%). For 
stent expansion, the agreement of CA -GPT (78.4%) was sign ificantly higher than that 
of ChatGPT -5 (33.0%, P<0.001) and comparable to junior physicians (84.1%, P=1.000). 
In stent apposition assessment, CA -GPT (93.2%) performed significantly better than 
junior physicians (76.1%, P<0.05), while no significant differ ence was observed 
compared to ChatGPT -5 (88.6%, P=0.402).  
 
Subgroup Analysis Reveals Differential Advantages of CA -GPT  
Subgroup analyses delineated the specific scenarios where CA -GPT demonstrated its 
strongest utility ( Table S3 ). In pre -PCI planning, CA -GPT's superiority over ChatGPT -
5 was consistent across all subgroups (all P<0.05). Compared to junior physicians, its 
performance was context -dependent: CA -GPT achieved significantly higher agreement 
in LCx/RCA lesions (5[4 -5] vs . 4[2 -4], P<0.01), lesions with significant ischemia 
(OCT -FFR≤0.80; 5[4 -5] vs. 4[3 -4], P<0.001), ACS presentations (5[3.25 -5] vs. 4[3 -
4.75], P<0.01 ), and mildly calcified lesions (5[4 -5] vs. 4[3 -4], P<0.001). However, no 
statistically significant difference was found between CA -GPT and junior physicians in 
LAD lesions (P=0.076), non -ischemic lesions (OCT -FFR >0.80; P=1.000), SCAD 
(P=1.000), or severe ly calcified lesions (P=0.708). In post -PCI assessment, the 
performance pattern shifted. CA -GPT maintained significant superiority over 
ChatGPT -5 in all subgroups. Its advantage over junior physicians was more localized, 
reaching statistical significance o nly in LCx/RCA lesions (5[5 -5] vs. 5[4 -5], P<0.05), 
while showing comparable performance in all other subgroups including LAD lesions 
(P=0.408), ACS (P=0.060), and SCAD (P=0.267).  
 
Representative Case Demonstrating High Decision Concordance of CA-GPT   
A representative case ( Figure 3) demonstrates CA-GPT integrated decision -support 
capability. In a complex LAD lesion with significant calcification, the system provided 
comprehensive procedural planning including precise device sizing and optimization 
strategies, achieving perfect agreement with the actual expert -performed procedure 
across all evaluation metrics.  
Discussion  
This study presents a novel CA-GPT-based AI -OCT system  that integrates intravascular 

imaging with a RAG framework for OCT -guided PCI decision support . Our 
comparative analysis reveals a distinct performance hierarchy: the RAG -enhanced CA-
GPT-based system  demonstrated superior agreement with expert consensus, 
outperforming both junior interventionalists and the general -purpose ChatGPT -5. This 
gradient not only validates the technical advantage of a purpose -built, integrated AI 
system  in specialized medical domains but also highlights the transformative potential 
of integrating structured cli nical knowledge with real -time image analysis . 
 
In our study, the CA -GPT showed remarkable improvements in decision -making 
consistency across multiple PCI decision metrics. Specifically, stent diameter selection 
was accurately chosen 90.3% of the time by CA -GPT, outperforming junior physicians 
(72.2%, P <0.05) and ChatGPT -5 (63.9%, P<0.001). This consistent performance 
underscores the system’s potential to mitigate the variability often introduced by 
operator -dependent factors, particularly for junior physicians with limited experience. 
Furthermore, the p erformance of CA -GPT in stent length selection (80.6% vs . 52.8%, 
P<0.01) was significantly higher than that of junior physicians, again demonstrating its 
superior utility in providing accurate and standardized PCI decisions.  
 
The critical advantage of the CA -GPT-based AI -OCT system  lies in its RAG 
architecture, which effectively bridges the gap between data -driven AI and evidence -
based clinical practice. In contemporary interventional cardiology, the rapid evolution 
of guidelines and the overwhelming clinical workload often create c hallenges for 
physicians, particularly junior operators, in maintaining updated knowledge and 
consistent decision -making. The integrated AI -OCT system  addresses this fundamental 
need by grounding its reasoning in a continuously updated knowledge base 
encompassing current guidelines and extensive real cases.18-20 This approach ensures 
that each recommendation is not merely data -driven but is substantiated by validated 
clinical evidence, thereby creating a "computerized decision support system" that aligns 
with the core principles of evidence -based medicine . 
 
The RAG framework proved crucial in mitigating the well -documented risks of AI 
"hallucinations" in clinical contexts.28 General -purpose large language models, like 
ChatGPT -5, may produce outputs that sound plausible but lack factual accuracy when 
applied to specialized medical tasks. These “hallucinations” are especially problematic 
in high -stakes settings like PCI, where clinical decision -making is heavily dependent 
on precision. RAG addresses this issue by grounding the model's reasoning in a 
continuously updated knowledge base, ensuring that its outputs are not only data -driven 
but also substantiated by validated clinica l evidence. Studies have shown that 
incorporating RAG enhances model accuracy by up to 18% in clinical reasoning tasks, 
particularly in complex scenarios such as diagnosing critical illness, where accurate, 
evidence -based decisions are critical for patient  outcomes .29-31 In our study, the CA -
GPT-based system , by embedding domain -specific knowledge through RAG, 
significantly outperformed general -purpose models like ChatGPT -5 in PCI decision -
making. This underscores the transformative potential of integrating  RAG within a 

dedicated AI -OCT platform  in improving clinical AI reliability and reducing errors in 
decision support systems.  
 
While ChatGPT -5 demonstrated impressive linguistic capabilities, its performance in 
specialized medical tasks was hindered by a lack of tailored training and evidence -
grounding. Several factors specific to our study context may have contributed to its 
subo ptimal performance. First, inaccuracies in translating complex Chinese medical 
terminology into English for querying ChatGPT -5 could have introduced errors or 
caused loss of nuance. This is particularly important in fields like PCI, where precise 
terminolo gy and context are crucial. Second, and more critically, ChatGPT -5’s training 
data predominantly comes from Western populations and international guidelines (e.g., 
American or European), which may not fully align with the Chinese expert consensus 
that serv ed as our reference standard.26,27 Discrepancies in lesion preparation 
philosophy, stent sizing practices, or expansion targets between guidelines could 
directly explain some of the observed disagreements. Our findings demonstrated that 
ChatGPT -5 achieved significantly lower agreement rates across most PCI decision 
metrics compared to the CA -GPT-based system , highlighting the limitations of generic 
AI in specialized procedural domains.  
 
A nuanced analysis of CA -GPT’s performance revealed strengths and areas for further 
enhancement. While the  system consistently achieved expert -level agreement on 
critical parameters such as minimum stent area (MSA) (100% agreement), its 
performance on metrics like pretreatment device selection (73.6%) and stent expansion 
assessment (78.4%) displayed inherent va riability typical of interventional practice. 
Experienced operators often rely on subtle clinical judgment, such as accommodating 
complex lesion anat omies, which can occasionally lead to deviations from guideline -
based thresholds . A similar issue was observed in AI -OCT studies. For example, the 
AutoOCT system performed well in standard cases, but struggled with complex lesions, 
such as heavily calcified or irregularly shaped lesions, where clinician decisions 
diverged from AI output s.32 This highlights that AI should act as an intelligent assistant, 
augmenting rather than replacing human decision -making. The CA -GPT-based AI-
OCT system  should be viewed similarly -while it excels in standardizing certain PCI 
decisions, clinical expertise remains paramount, especially in complex scenarios .33-37 
 
The clinical implementation of the CA -GPT-based AI -OCT system  addresses two major 
limitations in current OCT -guided PCI practice: operator -dependent interpretation 
variability and the time -intensive nature of manual analysis. Our system achieves 
expert -level agreement while dramatically reducing interpretation time from several 
minutes to mere seconds. This efficiency gain, combined with standardized decision 
outputs, positions CA -GPT as a valuable tool for enhancing workflow efficiency and 
procedural consi stency. By providing immediate, evidence -based feedback on critical 
parameters such as stent expansion, apposition  (93.2%) , and edge dissection  (97.7%) , 
the system can reduce reliance on post -hoc analysis and minimize intra -procedural 
uncertainty, potentially accelerating the adoption of OCT guidance in routine practice.  

 
From an educational perspective, the CA -GPT-based AI -OCT system  represents a 
transformative platform for competency -based training in interventional cardiology. 
Junior operators can leverage the system's transparent reasoning pathways to 
understand the evidence base underlying specific recommendations, compare their 
decisions against guideline -concordant standards, and receive structured feedback on 
discrepancies. This educational dimension not only shortens the learning curve for OCT 
interpretation but als o promotes consistent, high -quality practice across varying 
experience levels.38 The explainable nature of the system's  outputs, supported by its 
RAG framework, creates an optimal environment for developing both technical skills 
and clinical reasoning abilities.  
 
Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. (i) First, this was a single -
center, retrospective study, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other 
populations and imaging systems. External validation across multiple centers and 
differ ent clinical settings is required to confirm these results. (ii) The study did not 
include long -term clinical endpoint assessments such as MACE or mortality. However, 
this omission was intentional, as the primary aim of this work was to provide an initial,  
structured evaluation of CA -GPT ’s decision -making consistency rather than its long -
term prognostic value. Future prospective studies will be required to determine whether 
this consistency translates into improved clinical outcomes. (iii) Furthermore, while 
this study demonstrates signifi cant advancements in real -time decision support, future 
work should continue to explore the hybridization of human -AI workflows, where AI 
recommendations are dynamically weighted against operator judgment, to optimize 
clinical outcomes. These considerations will be essential for broader clinical 
implementation and integration of CA-GPT-based AI -OCT system  into routine practice.  
Conclusion  
This study demonstrates that the domain -specific , CA-GPT-based AI -OCT system  
significantly outperforms both a general -purpose large language model (ChatGPT -5) 
and junior interventionalists in pre -PCI procedural planning, while also achieving 
superior overall agreement in post -PCI assessment. Its performance was particularly 
strong  in complex clinical scenarios, such as lesions with significant ischemia and ACS 
presentations. By utilizing the CA -GPT to drive automated OCT analysis within a RAG 
framework,  this system  provides a standardized and reliable approach to intravascular 
imag ing interpretation and decision support. These findings highlight the potential of 
domain -specific AI to augment operator expertise, bridge skill gaps, and enhance the 
precision and standardization of OCT -guided PCI. The promising performance of the 
CA-GPT-based AI -OCT system  warrants further validation in large, m ulticenter, 
prospective studies .

Figure 3 Introduction to an CA-GPT-based AI -OCT System  Assisted Decision -Making 
Case  
The patient is a 61 -year-old male with an initial diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and unstable 
angina. Figure 3A: Pre -procedural angiography and OCT imaging revealed a 50% stenosis at the ostium of the LAD, 
a 75% stenosis in the proximal to mid segment of the LAD with visible diffuse calcification, and a 50% stenosis in 
the distal LAD. CA-GPT recommended pre -treatment using rotational atherectomy (1.25 mm burr) / a Shockwave 
balloon (2.5 × 12 mm), and suggested PCI with implantation of m ultiple drug -eluting stents (stent size 2.75 -3.0 × 
27 mm). The actual procedure employed a 2.75×12 mm Shockwave balloon, which was deployed 6 times at the 
calcified lesion for pre -treatment. This was followed by implantation of a distal stent (2.75×38 mm) and a proximal 
stent (3.0×23 mm). Figure 3B: The first post -procedural angiography and OCT imaging showed underexpansion of 
the stent. CA-GPT recommended further balloon dilation. Accordingly, during the actual procedure, a 2.75×12 mm 
Shockwave balloon was  advanced to the underexpanded segment of the stent and inflated 4 times at 6 atm. Figure 
3C: The second post -procedural angiography and OCT imaging demonstrated good stent apposition and expansion, 
with no edge dissection or hematoma. Multi -angle angiography confirmed TIMI grade 3 flow in the LAD, and the 
procedure was concluded. Simultaneously , CA-GPT indicated favorable results, confirming the absence of edge 
dissection and tissue prolapse.
