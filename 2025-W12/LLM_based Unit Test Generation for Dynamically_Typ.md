## Abstract
Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, but generating
effective tests for dynamically typed programs remains a significant challenge.
Existing approaches, including search-based software testing (SBST) and recent
LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and
assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this,
we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test
generation through a vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer
parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it
utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more
accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair
mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to
improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest
achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%,
outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

1 Introduction
Unit testing is essential for ensuring software correctness and im-
proving code quality. However, manually writing unit tests is often
labor-intensive and time-consuming [ 57], making automated test
generation a valuable research direction. Traditional unit test gener-
ation approaches include random-based methods [ 9,48], constraint-
driven techniques [ 16,19,26], and search-based software testing
(SBST) techniques [ 3,21,23,62]. Among these, EvoSuite [ 3], an
influential SBST-based tool, has demonstrated significant success
in generating unit tests, but it is specifically designed for Java, a
statically typed language.
For dynamically-typed language, Pynguin is the first SBST-based
method designed for Python and has been widely adopted [ 23]. It
employs search-based strategies to maximize code coverage but
heavily relies on type annotations to infer expected data types. How-
ever, Python‚Äôs flexible typing allows variables to take on different
types in different contexts, making static analysis insufficient for
accurately determining expected values. As a result, Pynguin often
struggles with generating valid inputs, leading to type inconsisten-
cies and incomplete test cases. Notably, an analysis of developer
‚àóCorresponding Authorqueries on GitHub and Stack Overflow indicates that 30% of the
questions relate to type issues, highlighting the challenges posed by
implicit typing in real-world software development [ 32]. The origi-
nal study on Pynguin also highlights the necessity of integrating
type inference techniques to enhance test case generation.
More recently, LLM-based test generation methods have shown
promising potential. Microsoft‚Äôs CodaMosa [ 21], an LLM-augmented
extension of Pynguin, combines SBST with LLM-generated test
cases. Specifically, CodaMosa employs search-based testing to ex-
plore the code until coverage stagnates, at which point it queries
an LLM to generate additional test cases for under-tested functions.
Similarly, CoverUp [ 20] integrates detailed coverage data into LLM
prompts, leveraging static analysis to focus on low-coverage code
regions. While these approaches improve test coverage, they still
face fundamental challenges in dynamically typed programs. In
particular, correctly assigning values of the expected type within
specific call contexts remains a significant obstacle, leading to fre-
quent test failures due to type mismatches. Existing approaches
infer types based on static analysis [ 2,13] or deep learning [ 1,29].
Static-based approaches typically fail to handle function arguments,
as they struggle to accurately infer the types of dynamically as-
signed values. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches, on the other
hand, exhibit difficulty in predicting user-defined types due to their
reliance on learned patterns from training data. These limitations
make it challenging to leverage type-inference techniques to assist
in test case generation, leaving a critical gap in existing methods.
This raises a key research question: For dynamically typed pro-
grams, how can we improve the type accuracy to enhance the
accuracy of generated test cases?
Addressing this question requires overcoming several key chal-
lenges:
(1)Constructing correct test objects: Accurately instantiating
objects of the class containing the function under test.
(2)Providing correctly typed function arguments: Ensuring
that function calls receive arguments of appropriate types.
(3)Generating valid assertions: Inferring expected return types
and object properties to construct meaningful assertions for
behavior verification.
Our approach. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
argument construction approach for dynamically typed programs.
This approach focuses on accurate type inference, thereby increas-
ing the likelihood of generating correctly typed variables for objectarXiv:2503.14000v1  [cs.SE]  18 Mar 2025

instantiation and function invocation. Based on this approach, we
develop TypeTest , a test generation framework that integrates two
main methods to improve the type correctness. Given a function
ùëìunder test, TypeTest first employs call instance recovery , a di-
rect method that leverages existing usage instances of ùëìwithin
the project to infer the expected types of the object and parame-
ters. This method allows TypeTest to extract concrete examples
of howùëìis invoked in real-world code, improving the accuracy of
generated test inputs.
When no direct usage instances are available, TypeTest applies
a more general approach: Feature-based Retrieval . Inspired by the
‚ÄúDuck Test‚Äù1, this method infers types by analyzing a parameter‚Äôs
behavior and matching it to known types with similar characteris-
tics. Specifically, it extracts the behavior features of the key variable,
such as its methods, attributes, and operations, and retrieves types
that exhibit similar usage patterns. This approach enables TypeTest
to approximate types based on functional behaviors rather than
relying solely on static type annotations.
Beyond input construction, TypeTest improves assertion gen-
eration through call graph-based analysis . Using topological and
reverse topological traversal of the call graph, this method extracts
function behavior and high-level semantics, enriching the context
provided to LLMs. This additional information enables LLMs to
generate more precise and semantically meaningful assertions. Fi-
nally, TypeTest employs an iterative refinement mechanism to
improve test quality. It prompts LLMs within a structured repair-
and-improvement loop, incrementally refining test cases based on
execution feedback. To achieve higher coverage, TypeTest marks
uncovered statements and strategically guides LLM-generated test
cases toward these regions in subsequent iterations.
We evaluate TypeTest on 125 real-world Python modules, where
it achieves an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch
coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art tools by 5.4% and
9.3%. Furthermore, compared to a variant that replaces TypeTest ‚Äôs
type inference with a state-of-the-art type inference tool, TypeTest
improves statement coverage and branch coverage by 6.0% and
10.5%. Through further investigation, we find that the improvement
in coverage is most strongly correlated with the correctness of
inferred types.
In summary, our contributions are summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢We present the first approach that explicitly addresses type cor-
rectness in unit test generation for dynamically-typed languages.
Specifically, we design and implement a type inference approach
tailored for Python.
‚Ä¢We develop a vector-based RAG framework that enables precise
type inference and type-correct parameter construction. This
framework allows TypeTest to effectively integrate source code
to support accurate type inference, object and argument con-
struction, and assertion generation.
‚Ä¢We conduct a comprehensive evaluation against three state-of-
the-art unit test generation tools. Experimental results demon-
strate that TypeTest significantly improves both statement and
branch coverage, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world
Python projects.
1Duck Test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test2 Motivation
We use the get_custom_loader function from the PyCG2project
as a representative example to illustrate our motivation. PyCG is
an open-source project on GitHub with 332 stars. It generates call
graphs by analyzing Python code and supports advanced features
such as higher-order functions and complex class inheritance struc-
tures.
As shown in Listing 1a, get_custom_loader returns a custom
module loader, CustomLoader . During initialization, ig_obj is re-
sponsible for maintaining module import relationships: it first cre-
ates import edges, then checks whether the module already exists
in the graph. If the module is not present, a new node is created, and
its file path is recorded. This mechanism enables the simultaneous
construction and management of module dependencies during the
loading process, facilitating subsequent analysis.
def get_custom_loader(ig_obj):
class CustomLoader(importlib.abc.SourceLoader):
def __init__(self, fullname, path):
self.fullname = fullname
self.path = path
ig_obj.create_edge(self.fullname)
if not ig_obj.get_node(self.fullname):
ig_obj.create_node(self.fullname)
ig_obj.set_filepath(self.fullname,
self.path)

Listing 1: An example of code and the corresponding auto-
generated unit tests.
We employ the unit test generation tool CodaMosa [ 21] to gen-
erate test cases for the get_custom_loader function. Initially, Co-
daMosa utilizes search-based software testing (SBST) to produce
simple test cases, as shown in Listing 1b. The test case sets bool_0
to True and passes it to get_custom_loader . However, since the
constructor of CustomLoader accesses members of the ig_obj pa-
rameter, any instantiation of CustomLoader results in a runtime
error, preventing further improvements in coverage. When SBST
fails to enhance coverage, CodaMosa activates the large language
model to generate test cases. One of the test cases generated by
GPT-4o is shown in Listing 1c. In this case, GPT-4o constructs

theImportGraph class and ensures that all members accessed by
the__init__ function of CustomLoader are present, thus prevent-
ing run-time errors. However, due to the absence of explicit type
information for ig_obj , GPT-4o is unable to infer the exact im-
plementations of methods such as create_edge . Instead, it relies
solely on method names to approximate their behavior, leading
to inconsistencies between the generated test case and the actual
implementation. CodaMosa then makes 16 additional attempts, all
of which fail. The primary cause of this failure is that CodaMosa
does not provide type information in its prompts, preventing GPT-
4o from generating semantically valid test cases. To infer the type
ofig_obj , we employ Hityper [ 35], which is the state-of-the-art
tool for type inference. However, Hityper incorrectly infers ig_obj
as astrtype. This incorrect inference arises because ig_obj is a
function parameter without any direct assignment statements to
aid type inference. Moreover, since ig_obj is a user-defined type,
the deep learning component of Hityper struggles to infer its type
accurately.

Listing 2: The unit tests generated by TypeTest
In contrast, our tool, TypeTest , effectively addresses these chal-
lenges. It first utilizes LLMs to generate summaries for the source
code, which are then indexed to construct a comprehensive knowl-
edge base. When TypeTest detects insufficient contextual infor-
mation, it retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base,
specifically focusing on the type information for key variables
within the unit under test. For example, when generating test cases
for theget_custom_loader ,TypeTest retrieves details about the
ig_obj . In the__init__ function of CustomLoader ,ig_obj in-
vokes member methods such as create_edge andget_node , which
are responsible for maintaining module import relationships. To
resolve the type of ig_obj ,TypeTest identifies classes that define
these methods and are semantically related to import management.
It subsequently locates the ImportManager class and extracts infor-
mation about its constructor (as illustrated in Listing 2a and further
explained in Section 3.2.3). By incorporating this information into
the prompt, GPT-4o can instantiate an ImportManager object and
pass it as an argument to get_custom_loader , as demonstratedin Listing 2b. This approach enables TypeTest to successfully in-
stantiate loader_class and achieve full statement coverage for
get_custom_loader , thereby not only improving test coverage but
also generating assertions that verify the core functionality of the
function.
This example demonstrates that accurately inferring type in-
formation for key variables can significantly enhance both the
coverage of generated test cases and the quality of assertions. Ex-
isting approaches, when handling dynamically typed languages
like Python, frequently overlook critical contextual information,
resulting in poor-quality test cases generated by GPT-4o. Address-
ing this limitation requires a method capable of searching across
the entire project, filtering relevant information, and accurately
inferring variable types. TypeTest fulfills this requirement, making
it a promising solution for improving automated test generation in
dynamically typed languages.
3 Methodology
We introduce TypeTest to tackle the challenges in unit test genera-
tion for dynamically typed programs, with its workflow depicted
in Figure 3. TypeTest operates through a four-step process: (1)
Given the program ùëù,TypeTest first generates summaries for each
functions and vectorizes them to build a knowledge base, which
will be utilized in the following RAG process. (2) For a given focal
functionùëì,TypeTest then identifies the class ùëêthat contains ùëìand
resolve the types of ùëì‚Äôs parameters. The resolved types are then
utilized to construct unit test with correct testing environment and
arguments. (3) TypeTest then generates assertions for each auto-
generated unit test by inferring the code semantics according to the
code summary. (4) At last, TypeTest fixes the potential compilation
and assertion errors in the auto-generated unit test and discards
the invalid ones. In the following, we detail our methodology.
3.1 Vector-based RAG framework
Given a focal function, generating its high-quality unit tests via
LLMs usually rely on the understanding its context. Previous ap-
proaches predominantly extract relevant context [ 51] by statically
analyzing source code. While static analysis proves effective for
strongly typed languages such as Java, it is less suitable for dynam-
ically typed languages, where variable types and function return
values are often implicit and may change at runtime. This dynamic
nature makes it challenging for static analysis to accurately infer
types for parameters and variables, potentially leading to inaccura-
cies in generated test cases. To address these challenges, TypeTest
utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to re-
trieve relevant contextual information, which serves as a foundation
for subsequent test generation methods. In this section, we present
the construction process of the knowledge base used in RAG and
outline the key steps involved in its application.
3.1.1 Knowledge base construction. The knowledge base comprises
three primary components: code summary, source code, and exist-
ing test cases, as shown in Listing 3.

tem. Summary-based in-
dexing has been shown to
significantly enhance re-
trieval accuracy [11]. As a
result, TypeTest employs
Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate seman-
tic summaries for func-
tions and classes, which
serve as reference points
for retrieving relevant con-
text.
The source code is a crit-
ical component, as it pro-
vides most of the contextual information used by RAG. For each
function in the program under test, we extract the module path,
unit name, source code, and docstring using abstract syntax trees
(AST). This structured information aids in the generation of test
cases. For example, when RAG retrieves a constructor, as shown
in Listing 2a, it also obtains the corresponding module path, en-
suring correct import‚Äúfrom pycg.machinery.imports import
ImportManager‚Äù is generated.
The existing test cases further support test generation by serving
as additional prompts for LLMs [ 61]. For instance, given a focal
functionùëìfrom classùëê, it the unit test of ùëê‚Äôs constructor exists, it
can be leveraged to instantiate the object when generating new test
cases forùëì. To utilize these effectively, TypeTest integrates both
existing and newly generated test cases into the RAG knowledge
base, storing key metadata such as the path, name of the focal
function, and test case source code.
Figure 4: An instance of the RAG process.
3.1.2 RAG process. As illustrated in Figure 4, the RAG process
begins when a query is received from other components within
TypeTest . This query triggers a retrieval operation over the knowl-
edge base to identify the most relevant information documents.
These relevant documents are then processed by an LLM, which
filters, deduplicates, and integrates them into a cohesive response.
The refined information is subsequently returned to the requesting
component. Retrieved documents are ranked using Maximal Mar-
ginal Relevance (MMR), which balances relevance and diversity to
improve the quality of the results. This architecture enables any
process within TypeTest to request specific contextual information
by submitting a query, prompting the RAG process to retrieve and
consolidate relevant data from the knowledge base.
3.2 Type Inference and Parameter Construction
for Unit Test Generation
The core issue for generating unit tests for dynamically typed pro-
gram is ‚Äúcreate objects and parameters with the correct type.‚Äù Al-
gorithm 1 is proposed to address type resolution issues, which
leverages two key strategies: referencing existing call instances and
using feature-based retrieval .
3.2.1 Overview. Generating unit tests for dynamically typed lan-
guages requires constructing correctly typed objects and invoking

focal functions with appropriately typed parameters. This ensures
that both constructors and focal functions are called correctly. The
underlying problem can be formalized as follows: given a focal
functionùëì, which may be a constructor ( __init__ ) or an instance
method, it must be invoked correctly. This involves:
‚Ä¢Inferring the types of ùëì‚Äôs parameters Para.
‚Ä¢Constructing instances of Para based on the inferred types.
As shown in Algorithm 1, TypeTest takes as input a call graph
ùëêùëîof program under test and a function ùëìwith a set of parame-
tersùëÉùëéùëüùëé ={ùëùùëéùëüùëé 1,ùëùùëéùëüùëé 2,...,ùëùùëéùëüùëé ùëõ}. The output is a set of con-
structed parameters ùëÄforùëì, where each parameter is instantiated
according to its inferred type. The algorithm begins by extracting
pre-existing call instances of ùëìfromùëêùëî, denoted as ùëÉùêº(line 2). For
each parameter ùëùùëéùëüùëé , its type is inferred based on its usage patterns
and the call instances observed in ùëÉùêº, using the InferType function.
The inferred type is stored in ùë°ùë¶ùëùùëí (line 6). Ifùë°ùë¶ùëùùëí is of primitive
type, the corresponding argument ùëöis constructed directly (line 9).
Ifùë°ùë¶ùëùùëí is identified as a user-defined type, the argument is con-
structed using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this
process, TypeTest first checks for the presence of a type annotation.
If a type annotation is available, TypeTest constructs directly an
object based on the annotation (line 14). Otherwise, it retrieves
relevant contextual information from the knowledge base based on
the characteristics of ùëùùëéùëüùëé to construct a suitable object (line 17).
This process iterates until the final custom object is successfully
instantiated and added ùëÄ, ensuring that all necessary dependencies
are correctly resolved.

20returnùëÄ;3.2.2 Resolve type by referring to pre-existing instances. First, pa-
rameter type resolution can be facilitated by referring to pre-existing
instances. Given a focal function ùëì, pre-existing instance refers to
usage ofùëì(e.g., invocation of target function) within the program.
Such instances can help LLM better understand how to invoke
ùëì, hence inferring the parameter type. For example, for function
set_num(a) , a pre-existing instance set_num(1) exists within the
project. When generating test cases, LLM can refer to this pre-
existing instance, easily infer the type of ùëéasInteger . To obtain
pre-existing instances, TypeTest first obtains the call graph of the
whole program ùëùunder test. For each focal function, TypeTest
gets its pre-existing instances according to the call graph and gets
the context of invocation of ùëì. The context includes the code to
create arguments to invoke ùëì. For simplification, the context of pre-
existing instance ùëùùëñ(which invokes ùëì) is defined as the function
where theùëùùëñlocates while eliminating the code after ùëùùëñ. This is
because the arguments for invoking ùëìare usually defined in the
local function before ùëùùëñ.
After collecting all existing pre-existing instances of ùëì, to avoid
overwhelming LLM, TypeTest sorts the collected instances accord-
ing to the length of code. The pre-existing instances with shorter
context are prioritized since the shorter context usually introduce
fewer noise and easier to be parsed by LLM. With the selected
pre-existing instance and its context, LLM then infer the parameter
types from the source code.
3.2.3 Resolve type by feature-based retrieval. Although referencing
pre-existing instances is an effective approach for type resolution,
some units may lack such instances. Moreover, due to Python‚Äôs
dynamic nature, no algorithm can construct a perfect call graph,
making the available pre-existing instances inherently incomplete.
As a result, relying on pre-existing instances is not always effective.
In this section, we explain how to resolve types using feature-
parameter retrieval, as described in Algorithm 1 line 17.
Our approach is inspired by the Duck Test ,3. This principle relies
on identifying an object‚Äôs behavior and characteristics to determine
its type, rather than requiring explicit type annotations. Specifically,
if a parameter para iof function ùëìis a number, it can be utilized
in mathematical calculation. If para iis an object, it can be used to
access its field and invoke its associated method. Such information
can be used to infer their types. To utilize such information, we
define the feature of each parameter para ias:
ùëìùëíùëéùë° ùëñ=operation(para i)+fieldAccess(para i)
+methodInvocation (para i)(1)
whereoperation(para i)represents the set of operation types with
para ias operand, such as ‚Äúmathematic operation‚Äù, ‚Äústring opera-
tion‚Äù, ‚Äúarray operation‚Äù and etc. Meanwhile, fieldAccess(para i)
andmethodInvocation (para i)represent the set of fields and meth-
ods (if exists) accessed via para i, respectively.
With the extracted features, if para iis of primitive type, such as
integer, string, it should be easily for LLM to recognize its type. If
para iis an object, TypeTest then retrieve the knowledge base to
search for a class definition, with
ùëê=Definition(ùêπùëñùëíùëôùëë)+Definition(ùëÄùëíùë°‚Ñéùëúùëë)+getName(ùëê)(2)

fields and methods defined in class ùëê. Such that, fieldAccess(para i)
is a subset of Definition(ùêπùëñùëíùëôùëë), andmethodInvocation (para iis

Test filters the knowledge base accordingly. It then prompts the
LLMs to summarize the behavior of para ibased on its execution in
functionùëìand generates a query to retrieve relevant documentation
for classùëêfrom the filtered knowledge base.
Example. Listing 4 demonstrates how the RAG retrieve parame-
ter type based on feature through a simple illustrative example. The
focal function, shown in Listing 5a, is from an open-source GitHub
project called code2flow4.code2flow is a tool that generates call
graphs and has garnered 4k stars on GitHub. The Call class de-
fines a field owner_token and a function matches_variable . The
matches_variable method of the Call class accepts a parameter
of typeVariable , performs some processing, and checks whether
thetoken of the passed variable equals the owner_token of the
instance to which the method belongs. If they are equal, it returns
thepoints_to of the passed variable .
When generating test cases without using the RAG process, the
parameter variable in thematches_variable method does not
contain type annotations, leaving LLM unaware of the parameter
type. To address this, a new class, MockVariable , was created to
simulate the behavior of the Variable class. However, the mocked
methodpoint_to_node in theMockVariable class differs from the
one defined in the Variable class, resulting in incorrect behaviors.
In contrast, TypeTest filters potential types based on the mem-
bers accessed by variable inmatches_variable . Furthermore,
the query is generated using the characteristics of variable , as
shown in Listing 5c. Even in the absence of type annotations in the
focal function, we can observe that relevant documentation for the
Variable class was retrieved, as illustrated in Listing 5d. With this
retrieved information, the LLM can generate accurate test cases, as
demonstrated in Listing 5e.
3.3 Assertion Generation Based on Function
Summarization
LLMs excel at understanding simple functions and generating cor-
responding test cases. However, when the focal function is highly
complex, especially when it invokes other functions, LLMs often
lack sufficient context to fully comprehend its behavior, leading to
incorrect assertion generation. To mitigate this issue, summarizing
the function can provide essential information while preventing
excessive context length. This section introduces how TypeTest
leverages the call graph to generate summaries for the focal func-
tion.
3.3.1 Topological traversal for function behavior analysis. A pre-
cise understanding of a function‚Äôs internal behavior is crucial for
generating effective test cases, as it enables LLMs to produce more
accurate assertions. However, in the case of a complex focal func-
tionùëì, its call statements often obscure critical execution logic,
making it challenging for the model to fully comprehend ùëì.
To address this, TypeTest organizes all functions in the program
in ‚Äútopological order‚Äù based on call graph, ensuring that functions

are analyzed in a structured manner. To construct the call graph
of the project under test, we employ PyCG[ 39] to extract function
dependencies. Let ùê∂ùëéùëôùëôùëíùëë(ùëì)denote the set of all functions invoked
byùëì,ùëì.ùë†ùëêrepresent the source code of ùëì, andùê¥ùëõùëéùëôùë¶ùë†ùëñùë† denote the
behavior analysis method. The behavior of ùëìis then computed as
follows:
f.behavior =Analysis(f.sc+‚àëÔ∏Å
ùë•‚ààCalled(f)x.behavior) (3)
For functions with recursive calls, TypeTest handles cycles by
temporarily removing one dependency edge during sorting. By
incorporating function behaviors in a structured manner, This ap-
proach provides LLMs with richer contextual information, thereby
enhancing their ability to comprehend function behavior.
3.3.2 Reverse topological traversal for high-level functional seman-
tics. While the previous step allows LLMs to capture fine-grained

LLM-based Unit Test Generation for Dynamically-Typed Programs Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA
behavioral details of each function, it does not provide a holistic
understanding of a function‚Äôs high-level semantics. To address this
issue, TypeTest employs a reverse topological traversal, analyzing
functions from higher-level entry points downward to infer the
purpose of each function.
Letùê∂ùëéùëôùëô(ùëì)denote the set of functions that invoke a given func-
tionùëì, and letùêºùëõùëìùëíùëü represent the inference mechanism. The se-
mantics of function ùëìis then computed as follows:
f.semantics =Infer(f.sc+Call(f).sc+Call(f).semantics)(4)
For functions with zero in-degree in the call graph (i.e., top-level
functions), TypeTest searches for the nearest relevant documen-
tation file (e.g., README.md) to serve as a proxy for ùê∂ùëéùëôùëô(ùëì). By
leveraging the overall program context, LLMs can infer the seman-
tics of top-level functions more effectively, ultimately improving
assertion generation accuracy.
3.4 Generation with Repair and Iterative
Improvement
This section explains how TypeTest prompts LLM to generate
test cases and incrementally improve coverage through iterative
generation.
3.4.1 Test case generation and repair. We design a system prompt
to instruct the LLM. First, it defines the model‚Äôs role as an expert
Python programmer, a strategy that has proven effective in generat-
ing code based on prior research [ 49]. Additionally, we provide the
module location of ùëìto ensure proper imports in the generated test
code. The prompt directs the LLM to generate pytest test cases for
ùëìusing the previously gathered information. To improve response
quality, we employ a step-by-step reasoning approach, which prior
studies have shown enhances LLM outputs [14].
Since the size of ùëìcan vary, the prompt may occasionally ex-
ceed the maximum token limit. To mitigate this, we use OpenAI ‚Äôs
tiktoken library to truncate any parts that exceed the limit. As a
result, the ordering of components within the prompt becomes crit-
ical. Beyond the system prompt, we prioritize retaining the unit‚Äôs
source code and, when necessary, omit context that aids in assertion
generation. Ultimately, this process produces an initial test case ùë°
forùëì.
Despite providing a comprehensive context to the LLM, ùë°may
still contain syntax and assertion errors. In straightforward cases,
LLM can identify and correct such issues based solely on the er-
ror report, without needing extra context. Therefore, for initial
repairs, we include both the source code of ùë°and the error report
in the prompt. However, some errors, like module import errors,
may still persist due to insufficient contextual information avail-
able to the model. To address this, we leverage the RAG process,
as previously described, to retrieve relevant context dynamically.
This retrieval process often aligns well with the information in-
dicated in the error report. For instance, if an error report states,
‚ÄúUnable to find module path: target_module‚Äù , the RAG pro-
cess can retrieve a relevant module path, such as ‚Äúmodule path:
example.target_module‚Äù . Given the diverse range of potential
errors, it is impractical to define a fixed query template. Therefore,
we adopt a distributed approach, dividing the query generationtask into two steps: analyzing the cause of the error and generating
the corresponding query. LLM uses a chain of thought processes to
produce a coherent query. Finally, we use the source code of ùë°, the
error report, and information retrieved by the query to repair the
error ofùë°. If the repair fails, we discard the test case.
3.4.2 Iterative unit test generation. One of the primary objectives
of test case generation is to maximize code coverage. To achieve
this, TypeTest adopts an iterative generation approach. After test-
ing all functions in ùëù,TypeTest evaluates coverage and initiates
a new testing round if necessary. Previous studies have shown
that prompting LLMs to generate test cases targeting uncovered
statements can improve coverage [ 20]. Coverage data is typically
provided as line numbers corresponding to uncovered statements.
However, LLMs are not adept at numerical reasoning, particularly
counting line numbers. To address this, TypeTest directly anno-
tates uncovered statements with comments, thereby guiding the
model to generate test cases for these specific locations. In addition,
test cases generated in earlier rounds often facilitate the genera-
tion of new test cases. They provide a comprehensive process for
parameter initialization, acting as more effective pre-existing in-
stances. To capitalize on this, we store these cases in a knowledge
base, allowing TypeTest to leverage them for type inference and
retrieval via RAG.
4 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate TypeTest by addressing the following
research questions.
RQ1: What is the effectiveness of TypeTest compared to
existing approaches?
RQ2: What is the impact of type inference techniques and
RAG on the effectiveness of TypeTest ?
RQ3: How does iterative strategy influence the improvement
ofTypeTest ‚Äôs coverage?
Benchmark .To address these questions, we utilize the bench-
mark provided by Pynguin [ 23], which we refer to as Pyn. This
benchmark has been widely adopted by tools such as CodaMosa [ 21]
and Coverup [ 20].Pyn comprises 17 real-world projects collected
from datasets such as BugsInPy [ 50] and ManyTypes4Py [ 28]. Fol-
lowing the selection criteria used by CodaMosa, we exclude mod-
ules that achieve 100% coverage within one minute, resulting in a
benchmark consisting of 125 modules. The statistics of the bench-
mark is shown in Table 1.
Baseline and Configuration. To evaluate TypeTest on the
Pyn benchmark, we use CodaMosa [ 21], CoverUp [ 20] and Chat-
Tester [ 58] as baselines. CodaMosa is a project in the field of unit
test generation, combining LLMs with search algorithms. It can
generate new test cases through intelligent queries for Python
projects, especially when encountering coverage bottlenecks. Chat-
Tester [ 58] is initially developed for Java-based test generation. For
comparison purposes, we adapt ChatTester to support Python pro-
grams by using a similar prompt. ChatTester relies on static code
analysis to obtain class information. CoverUp [ 20] is a novel sys-
tem that drives the generation of high-coverage Python regression
tests via a combination of coverage analysis and LLMs. The specific
experimental parameters are as follows:

‚Ä¢For RAG configuration of TypeTest , we employ the "BAAI/bge-
large-en-v1.5" model available on Hugging Face for embeddings5.
To ensure efficient and scalable querying, TypeTest leverages
Chroma6to build vector-based indices, enabling fast retrieval.
‚Ä¢For ChatTester, CoverUp, and TypeTest , we use gpt-4o-2024-05-
13 with the same model parameters. Specifically, we configure all
three methods to perform three rounds of test generation, where
each round generates a test case for every function in the target
project.
‚Ä¢Noting that CodaMosa(gpt4o) performs slightly worse than Co-
daMosa(codex), consistent with the findings of the CoverUp
study [ 20], and considering that Codex is no longer available,
we utilize the experimental data provided by CodaMosa for com-
parison. This dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/
microsoft/codamosa-dataset.
4.1 RQ1: Effectiveness of TypeTest
Coverage .Following CoverUp‚Äôs approach, which measures mod-
ule level coverage [ 20], we evaluate the statement and branch cov-
erage of tests generated by TypeTest in comparison to CoverUp,
ChatTester, and CodaMosa.
Figure 1 shows the experimental results. In terms of cover-
age,TypeTest achieved the highest statement coverage average
(86.6%) compared to CoverUp (77.4%), CodaMosa (81.2%) and Chat-
Tester (63.1%). Additionally, it boasts the highest branch coverage
of 76.8%, surpassing CoverUp (62.0%), CodaMosa (67.5%), and Chat-
Test (41.1%). These results indicate that the test samples generated
byTypeTest provide better coverage of the tested project. Our
improvements mainly occur on programs with a large number of
dynamic types, on which CodaMosa and CoverUp achieve very low
coverage, even 0% for some cases.
In terms of stability, TypeTest (8.6%) exhibits a lower standard de-
viation compared to CodaMosa (16.2%), CoverUp (13.0%), and Chat-
Tester (18.0%) in the coverage of statement. Moreover, when com-
paring the standard deviations of branch coverage with CoverUp
(15.6%), CodaMosa (22.7%) and ChatTester (22.6%), TypeTest (11.9%)
5https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
6https://github.com/chroma-core/chromahas the second lowest standard deviation. The factor that affects
standard deviation is the low coverage. Meanwhile, TypeTest also
achieves the highest lower bound, with the lowest proportion of
cases where statement coverage is below 40%, at only 3.2%. In con-
trast, CoverUp, CodaMosa, and ChatTester exhibit proportions of
15.2%, 9.6%, and 24.0%, respectively. This indicates that TypeTest
demonstrates greater stability in most scenarios.
Since CodaMosa achieves the second-highest coverage after
TypeTest , we select CodaMosa for further analysis. In the modules
where TypeTest achieves higher coverage, the most significant
difference is observed in the ùëíùë•ùëêùë† module of the ùëùùë¶ùë°ùë¢ùë°ùëñùëôùë† project,
where TypeTest attains 100% coverage while CodaMosa achieves
0%. This module contains a single function, ùëúùëò, which suppresses
exceptions specified by the ùëíùë•ùëêùëíùëùùë°ùëñùëúùëõùë† parameter. CodaMosa fails
to generate valid inputs for this parameter, whereas TypeTest suc-
ceeds, leading to full coverage.
In contrast, in modules where TypeTest has lower coverage than
CodaMosa, the lowest coverage is observed in the ùë°ùëüùëéùëõùë†ùëìùëúùëüùëöùëíùëüùë†
module of the ùëùùë¶_ùëèùëéùëêùëòùë§ùëéùëüùëëùë† project. This module utilizes the third-
party library ùë°ùë¶ùëùùëíùëë _ùëéùë†ùë°, which is aliased as ùëéùë†ùë°. LLMs mistakenly
identify it as Python‚Äôs standard ùëéùë†ùë°module, preventing effective test
case generation and limiting coverage improvement. Additionally,
while CodaMosa does not generate assertions, TypeTest produces
meaningful assertions and discards test cases when assertion fail-
ures occur. This behavior contributes to lower coverage in some
modules compared to test cases generated by CodaMosa.
Test Quality .High test coverage does not necessarily imply the
effectiveness of assertions; however, mutation testing can assess
assertion effectiveness by simulating faults [ 60]. Therefore, we use
mutation testing to further evaluate the quality of assertions gener-
ated by TypeTest . Since CodaMosa does not generate assertions,
we use mutmut7to measure the mutation score of test cases gen-
erated by the other three tools. In total, mutmut produced 5,341
mutants.

Figure 6: Mutation Score of different
toolsFigure 6 presents
the mean and vari-
ance of the muta-
tion scores achieved
by the three tools.
As shown, TypeTest
achieves an average
mutation score 19.8%
higher than CoverUp
and 23.8% higher than
ChatTester. Addition-
ally, the standard de-
viation of TypeTest ‚Äôs
mutation score is 9.4% lower than that of Coverup and 11.2% lower
than that of ChatTester. These results indicate that TypeTest sur-
passes the current state-of-the-art in both performance and stability
in mutation testing.
In summary, TypeTest can generate high coverage and
high mutation score tests more stably in test generation
than the previous state of the art.
4.2 RQ2: Ablation study on type inference
techniques and RAG
In this RQ, we conduct two experiments: replacing the type in-
ference tool to compare it with our type inference method, and
removing the RAG process to evaluate the overall impact of RAG.
Since the core advantage of TypeTest lies in providing LLMs
with ample contextual information based on type inference, it is
worth investigating whether existing type inference tools can ac-
complish the same task. Numerous Python type-inference tools
have been developed, such as Type4Py [ 29] and Hityper [ 35]. Among
them, Hityper effectively integrates static inference with deep learn-
ing techniques, making it the state-of-the-art solution.
Figure 7: Coverage results of TypeTest variants
To investigate the ability of Hityper in assisting test case gener-
ation, we removed the type inference component from TypeTest .
We then integrate Hityper to infer the types of focal function pa-
rameters and use static analysis to retrieve the corresponding class
definitions. LLMs are then employed to refine the extracted context,
constructing a more informative input. We denote this modified
version as TypeTest with Hityper. To further explore the overall
contribution of RAG to TypeTest , we removed all RAG componentsfrom TypeTest and named the modified version TypeTest without
RAG.
Figure 7 presents the coverage results of TypeTest ,TypeTest
with Hityper and TypeTest without RAG. From the figure, it is
evident that TypeTest consistently achieves higher statement and
branch coverage than the other two tools. Additionally, TypeTest
with Hityper generally outperforms TypeTest without RAG. We
further investigate the reasons behind these results.
On average, TypeTest achieves 6% higher statement coverage
than TypeTest with Hityper. This discrepancy is mainly due to
inaccuracies in Hityper‚Äôs parameter type inference. On one hand,
static inference struggles with parameter type analysis because
parameters act as function entry points for data flow, often lacking
explicit definitions or assignments [ 35]. On the other hand, deep
learning-based type inference performs poorly on rare types in
the dataset, particularly user-defined types. For example, in the
‚Ñéùë°ùë°ùëùùëñùëí project module ùëùùëôùë¢ùëîùëñùëõùë†.ùëöùëéùëõùëéùëîùëíùëü , many functions require a
parameter of type ùëáùë¶ùëùùëí[ùêµùëéùë†ùëíùëÉùëôùë¢ùëîùëñùëõ], whereùêµùëéùë†ùëíùëÉùëôùë¢ùëîùëñùëõ is a user-
defined type. However, Hityper incorrectly infers this type as ùë†ùë°ùëü,
leading to the generation of low-coverage, low-quality tests. In
contrast, the RAG system of TypeTest retrieves relevant contextual
information based on the parameter‚Äôs behavior within the function,
enabling the generation of test cases that achieve 100% coverage.
The average statement coverage of TypeTest exceeds that of
TypeTest without RAG by 11.9%. Compared to TypeTest ,TypeTest
without RAG lacks the ability to dynamically retrieve contextual
information from the project, making it less effective in handling
larger projects. For the five largest projects, TypeTest achieves
13.4% higher average statement coverage than TypeTest without
RAG, while for smaller projects, the improvement is 9.6%.
In summary, TypeTest ‚Äôs type inference is more effective
than Hityper in supporting test generation, as it better
handles user-defined types. Additionally, the RAG mecha-
nism plays a crucial role in dynamically retrieving relevant
context, significantly improving test coverage and overall
effectiveness.
Figure 8: TypeTest Statement coverage for each iteration

4.3 RQ3: Impact of Iterative Strategy
To assess the effectiveness of the iterative strategy, we conduct
experiments across multiple iterations. Figure 8 illustrates the state-
ment coverage achieved for each project over three iterations. The
iterative strategy significantly improves the statement coverage,
with the average coverage improving by 10.8% for the third iter-
ation. For example, for the project httpie , when using iterative
strategy, the statement coverage increases 22.4%. Further investiga-
tion, we observe that the iterative strategy performs better on the
projects whose first test generation‚Äôs coverage is low. We calculate
the coverage improvement on the project whose coverage is below
80% after the first iteration. The results show that the averaged
coverage increases by 15.3%, which highlights the help of iterative
strategy on the projects with low coverage. These results confirm
that iterative strategy boosts their ability to provide full coverage
of the tested code by increasing the low coverage.
In summary, the results confirm that the iterative strategy
improves overall code coverage.
5 Threats to Validity
The effectiveness of TypeTest faces challenges due to variations in
LLMs‚Äô performance, particularly regarding the applicability of LLMs
and their stability when handling projects with extensive codebases.
Although we achieved favorable results using GPT-4o, different
LLMs may yield varied outcomes, which impacts TypeTest ‚Äôs overall
performance. Additionally, as RAG relies on similarity matching
and the token limitation of LLMs, TypeTest ‚Äôs performance may
degrade when processing a single function with a large number
of lines of code. Future work will focus on improving scalability
for large codebases, minimizing retrieval omissions in the RAG
process, and testing a broader range of LLMs to enhance TypeTest ‚Äôs
generalization.
6 Related Work
Our work relates to the following areas: Search-Based Software
Testing (SBST), and LLM-based unit test generation.
6.1 Search Based Software Testing (SBST)
SBST employs search algorithms to automatically generate test
cases [ 15,24,42,47], which can greatly reduce the time developers
spend on test case creation [ 44], while also generating boundary
cases and exceptional inputs that are often challenging to identify
manually. Various SBST-based tools and algorithms have been devel-
oped to generate test cases for programming languages such as Java,
Python, and JavaScript, some of which support multiple testing
objectives, including statement and branch coverage [ 10,12,18,30].
EvoSuite [ 22,45,46] is a well-known tool based on SBST, which
automatically generates JUnit test suites that maximize code cover-
age. Randoop [ 33] is a feedback-directed random test generation
tool that generates test cases by randomly combining previously
executed statements that did not result in failures. Algorithm MOSA
(Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing) [ 43], and algorithms related
to it, such as DynaMOSA [ 34] and MIO (Many Independent Objec-
tive) [ 4,5], are used for test generation, and particularly effective athandling multiple objectives, containing line coverage, branch cov-
erage, and multiple mutants in mutation testing. Sapienz [ 6,27,31]
is an approach to Android testing that uses multi-objective SBST to
optimize test sequences for brevity and effectiveness in revealing
faults. Sapienze leverages a combination of random fuzzing, system-
atic exploration, and SBST. Pynguin is an extendable test-generation
framework for Python, which is a dynamic type programming lan-
guage [17, 23, 25, 37].
Despite the development of many SBST-based test case gener-
ation tools, they have notable limitations. These tools typically
produce only boundary condition test cases, with assertions limited
to simple equality checks. Additionally, when software updates
occur, generating new test cases can be time-consuming, even for
minimal changes. Furthermore, inaccurate type inference restricts
their effectiveness, particularly in dynamically-typed languages
like Python, which employs duck typing [ 24]. In contrast, Type-
Test generates test cases providing more accurate type inference,
enhancing overall test effectiveness.
6.2 LLM-Based Unit Test Generation
LLM-based unit test generation [ 41,55] is the technique that lever-
ages large language models trained to automatically generate unit
tests for software code. There has been a large number of works
or tools generating test cases with Large Language Models (LLMs)
[52,54,56], demonstrating impressive results. MuTAP [ 8] is a
prompt-based learning technique to generate effective test cases
with LLMs, which improves the effectiveness of test cases gener-
ated by LLMs in terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation
testing. TestPilot [ 40] is a tool for automatically generating unit
tests for npm packages written in JavaScript/TypeScript using LLM,
which provides LLM with the signature and implementation of
the function under test, along with usage extracted from the doc-
umentation. ChatUniTest [ 7,51] utilizes an LLM-based approach
encompassing valuable context in prompts and rectifying errors
in generated unit tests. ChatTester [ 58] is a Maven plugin similar
to ChatUnitTest above, which leverages ChatGPT to improve the
quality of its generated tests. LLM4Fin [ 53] is designed for testing
real-world stock-trading software, which generates comprehensive
testable scenarios for extracted business rules. CodaMosa [ 21] de-
veloped by Microsoft combines SBST and LLMs, using LLM to help
SBST‚Äôs exploration. LLM will provide examples for SBST when its
coverage improvements stall to help SBST search more useful areas.
Recent work [ 59] explores automated assertion generation with
LLMs, conducting a large-scale evaluation of different models and
demonstrating their effectiveness in improving assertion quality
and detecting real-world bugs. Reed et al. [ 36] investigates state-
based testing techniques for object-oriented software, leveraging
class-based unit tests and state-driven methodologies to improve
testing effectiveness in large-scale systems.
While existing tools rely on prompts to guide LLMs in generating
test cases, they fail to incorporate type information from previous
test cases. For instance, TestPilot does not adapt its prompts based
on type information, nor does it refine them when type information
does not improve. Similarly, CodaMosa only prompts the LLM when
necessary to support SBST, positioning the LLM as a supplementary
component rather than a primary driver of test case generation. In

LLM-based Unit Test Generation for Dynamically-Typed Programs Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA
contrast, our tool, TypeTest , leverages type information to guide
the LLM in generating test cases that are more likely to improve
coverage. This is achieved through the use of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) [ 38], which integrates the strengths of both re-
trieval and generative models, thereby enriching the LLM with
additional, context-specific information.
7 Conclusion
We proposed RAG-based type inference for Unit Test Generation,
a method that enhances the authenticity and correctness of test
cases for dynamically typed languages by utilizing accurate type
information during testing. By leveraging call instance retrieval and
feature-based retrieval, TypeTest improved the capability of LLMs
to construct correct test objects and invoke the function under test.
Furthermore, TypeTest enhanced the ability of LLMs to generate
assertions by employing call graph-based analysis. TypeTest also
employed an iterative strategy, utilizing the generated test cases
and coverage information to aid in subsequent generations and
improve coverage. We evaluated our approach on 17 open-source
projects and found that our performance was superior and more
stable compared to other tools. Future work will focus on extending
TypeTest to other dynamically-typed languages and improving its
efficiency.
