## Abstract
Content moderation for large language models (LLMs) remains a significant
challenge, requiring flexible and adaptable solutions that can quickly respond
to emerging threats. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Rejection (RAR),
a novel approach that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
architecture to dynamically reject unsafe user queries without model
retraining. By strategically inserting and marking malicious documents into the
vector database, the system can identify and reject harmful requests when these
documents are retrieved. Our preliminary results show that RAR achieves
comparable performance to embedded moderation in LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
while offering superior flexibility and real-time customization capabilities, a
fundamental feature to timely address critical vulnerabilities. This approach
introduces no architectural changes to existing RAG systems, requiring only the
addition of specially crafted documents and a simple rejection mechanism based
on retrieval results.

Introduction
 
Content
 
moderation
 
for
 
large
 
language
 
models
 
(LLMs)
 
is
 
increasingly
 
critical
 
as
 
LLMs
 
are
 
deployed
 
in
 
user-facing
 
applications.
 
Traditional
 
moderation
 
often
 
relies
 
on
 
static
 
classifiers
 
or
 
handcrafted
 
prompt
 
filters,
 
which
 
struggle
 
to
 
adapt
 
quickly
 
to
 
new
 
threats
 
[1]
.
 
Recent
 
analyses
 
show
 
that
 
even
 
retrieval-augmented
 
generation
 
(RAG)
 
pipelines
 
can
 
inadvertently
 
introduce
 
safety
 
risks,
 
causing
 
models
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
safety
 
profile
 
[2]
.
 
This
 
paper
 
presents
 
retrieval-augmented
 
rejection
 
(RAR),
 
a
 
novel
 
approach
 
that
 
repurposes
 
the
 
RAG
 
architecture
 
[3]
,
 
typically
 
used
 
to
 
enhance
 
LLM
 
knowledge,
 
as
 
a
 
dynamic
 
content
 
moderation
 
mechanism.
 
By
 
intentionally
 
adding
 
documents
 
that
 
mimic
 
harmful
 
content
 
and
 
questions
 
(which
 
we
 
term
 
"negative
 
documents")
 
to
 
the
 
vector
 
database
 
and
 
flagging
 
them
 
accordingly,
 
the
 
system
 
can
 
leverage
 
the
 
retrieval
 
mechanism
 
to
 
identify
 
and
 
reject
 
malicious
 
queries
 
without
 
requiring
 
model
 
retraining
 
or
 
architectural
 
changes.
 
The
 
key
 
contributions
 
of
 
this
 
work
 
include:
 
i)
 
a
 
novel
 
content
 
moderation
 
approach
 
that
 
requires
 
no
 
architectural
 
changes
 
to
 
existing
 
RAG
 
systems;
 
ii)
 
a
 
methodology
 
for
 
creating
 
and
 
maintaining
 
"negative
 
documents"
 
for
 
effective
 
query
 
filtering;
 
iii)
 
a
 
flexible
 
threshold-based
 
rejection
 
mechanism
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
dynamically
 
adjusted;
 
iv)
 
preliminary
 
evaluation
 
against
 
existing
 
content
 
moderation
 
approaches.

RAG
 
for
 
Classification
 
and
 
Moderation
 
The
 
use
 
of
 
RAG
 
systems
 
for
 
classification
 
tasks
 
is
 
a
 
growing
 
area
 
of
 
research.
 
Chen
 
et
 
al.
 
proposed
 
Class-RAG,
 
a
 
classification
 
approach
 
that
 
employs
 
retrieval-augmented
 
generation
 
for
 
content
 
moderation
 
[4]
.
 
Their
 
work
 
demonstrates
 
that
 
RAG
 
can
 
effectively
 
add
 
context
 
to
 
elicit
 
reasoning
 
for
 
content
 
moderation
 
decisions.
 
They
 
found
 
that
 
Class-RAG
 
outperforms
 
traditional
 
fine-tuned
 
models
 
in
 
classification
 
tasks
 
and
 
shows
 
greater
 
robustness
 
against
 
adversarial
 
attacks
 
[4]
.
 
This
 
work
 
represents
 
the
 
closest
 
approach
 
to
 
our
 
proposed
 
RAR
 
system,
 
though
 
it
 
focuses
 
more
 
on
 
classification
 
for
 
decision-making
 
rather
 
than
 
using
 
the
 
retrieval
 
mechanism
 
itself
 
for
 
rejection.
 
Adversarial
 
Documents
 
and
 
RAG
 
Vulnerabilities
 
Recent
 
research
 
has
 
identified
 
vulnerabilities
 
in
 
RAG
 
systems
 
related
 
to
 
document
 
manipulation.
 
The
 
concept
 
of
 
"blocker
 
documents"
 
was
 
introduced
 
by
 
Shafran
 
et
 
al.
 
(2024),
 
investigating
 
jamming
 
attacks
 
on
 
RAG
 
systems
 
[5]
.
 
They
 
demonstrated
 
that
 
a
 
single
 
carefully
 
crafted
 
document
 
in
 
the
 
RAG
 
database
 
can
 
cause
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
refuse
 
to
 
answer
 
certain
 
queries.
 
Their
 
work
 
showed
 
that
 
a
 
single
 
blocker
 
document
 
in
 
the
 
RAG
 
database
 
can
 
be
 
sufficient
 
to
 
jam
 
the
 
system,
 
inducing
 
it
 
to
 
refuse
 
to
 
answer
 
certain
 
queries
 
[5]
.
 
Liang
 
et
 
al.
 
(2025)
 
similarly
 
show
 
that
 
RAG
 
exhibits
 
significant
 
vulnerability
 
to
 
adversarial
 
attacks,
 
with
 
naive
 
malicious
 
injections
 
easily
 
bypassing
 
retrievers
 
or
 
filters
 
[6]
.
 
These
 
works
 
focus
 
on
 
malicious
 
exploitation
 
of
 
RAG;
 
in
 
contrast,
 
RAR
 
purposefully
 
employs
 
such
 
documents
 
defensively.
 
By
 
treating
 
the
 
vector
 
database
 
as
 
a
 
tripwire
 
layer,
 
we
 
turn
 
the
 
known
 
“blocker
 
document”
 
threat
 
into
 
a
 
proactive
 
filtering
 
signal.
 
Content
 
Moderation
 
Pipelines
 
and
 
Guardrails.
 
Many
 
modern
 
moderation
 
systems
 
integrate
 
multiple
 
components
 
or
 
fine-tuned
 
models.
 
For
 
example,
 
Wildflare
 
GuardRail
 
[1]
 
is
 
a
 
pipeline
 
that
 
uses
 
an
 
unsafe-input
 
detector,
 
a
 
context-grounding
 
module,
 
and
 
output
 
repairers
 
to
 
enforce
 
safety.
 
Similarly,
 
Ghosh
 
et
 
al.
 
propose
 
Aegis,
 
which
 
creates
 
a
 
large
 
curated
 
safety
 
dataset
 
and
 
trains
 
an
 
ensemble
 
of
 
LLM
 
“safety
 
experts”
 
to
 
filter
 
content
 
[7]
.
 
Finally,
 
LlamaGuard
 
leverages
 
the
 
zero-shot
 
and
 
few-shot
 
abilities
 
of
 
the
 
Llama2-7B
 
architecture
 
[8]
 
and
 
can
 
adapt
 
to
 
different
 
taxonomies
 
and
 
sets
 
of
 
guidelines
 
[9]
.
 
These
 
systems
 
achieve
 
high
 
performance
 
but
 
require
 
extensive
 
model
 
training
 
and
 
complex
 
orchestration.
 
By
 
contrast,
 
RAR’s
 
guardrails
 
are
 
implicit
 
in
 
the
 
retrieval
 
database:
 
no
 
additional
 
trained
 
models
 
or
 
rules
 
are
 
needed
 
beyond
 
adding
 
or
 
removing
 
documents.
 
Overall,
 
our
 
approach
 
is
 
novel
 
in
 
combining
 
aspects
 
of
 
RAG
 
retrieval
 
and
 
moderation
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
not
 
previously
 
proposed.
 
To
 
our
 
knowledge,
 
no
 
prior
 
work
 
has
 
exploited
 
intentionally
 
added
 
negative
 
documents
 
in
 
a
 
RAG
 
index
 
to
 
cause
 
rejection
 
of
 
malicious
 
inputs.
 
We
 
build
 
on
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
dynamic
 
updates
 
and
 
retrieval
 
context
 
(as
 
in
 
Class-RAG)
 
but
 
apply
 
it
 
directly
 
to
 
rejection.
 
We
 
further
 
leverage
 
the
 
known
 
RAG
 
jamming
 
effect
 
from
 
security
 
literature,
 
reinterpreting
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
rapid,
 
explainable
 
filtering
 
mechanism.
 
2.
 
Methods
 
2.1
 
System
 
Design
 
RAR
 
operates
 
within
 
a
 
standard
 
RAG
 
pipeline
 
with
 
minimal
 
modification,
 
as
 
illustrated
 
in
 
Figure
 
1.
 
We
 
maintain
 
a
 
vector
 
database
 
(the
 
knowledge
 
base)
 
that
 
contains
 
positive
 
documents
 
(legitimate
 
information)
 
and
 
negative
 
documents
 
(the
 
“tripwires”).
 
Negative
 
documents
 
are
 
crafted
 
textual
 
entries,
 
either
 
long
 
texts
 
or
 
single
 
questions,
 
that
 
appear
 
malicious
 
but
 
are
 
tagged
 
in
 
metadata
 
(e.g.,
 
category=“violence”,
 
reject=true).
 
These
 
2
 

 
documents
 
don’t
 
need
 
to
 
contain
 
any
 
actual
 
instructions,
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
illustrative
 
of
 
the
 
intent
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
reject.
 
When
 
a
 
user
 
query
 
arrives,
 
RAR
 
embeds
 
the
 
query
 
and
 
retrieves
 
the
 
top-
k
 
nearest
 
documents
 
from
 
the
 
database
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
embedding
 
space
 
as
 
the
 
LLM.
 
If
 
any
 
retrieved
 
document
 
is
 
marked
 
as
 
negative
 
and
 
exceeds
 
the
 
configured
 
threshold,
 
the
 
system
 
immediately
 
rejects
 
the
 
query
 
instead
 
of
 
passing
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
LLM.
 
This
 
retrieval-based
 
check
 
essentially
 
asks:
 
“Does
 
this
 
query
 
match
 
the
 
style
 
or
 
content
 
of
 
any
 
known
 
malicious
 
intent?”
.
 
The
 
embedding-retriever
 
component
 
(unchanged
 
from
 
any
 
RAG
 
system)
 
feeds
 
results
 
into
 
a
 
simple
 
rejection
 
rule
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
generator.
 
This
 
means
 
no
 
changes
 
are
 
needed
 
to
 
the
 
LLM
 
or
 
model
 
parameters—only
 
to
 
the
 
database
 
contents
 
and
 
the
 
rejection
 
logic.

System
 
design
 
of
 
RAR.
 
The
 
standard
 
RAG
 
components
 
(retriever
 
and
 
LLM)
 
remain
 
unchanged.
 
Negative
 
and
 
positive
 
documents
 
are
 
stored
 
in
 
the
 
vector
 
index
 
(knowledge
 
base).
 
An
 
input
 
is
 
rejected
 
if
 
the
 
top-k
 
retrieval
 
contains
 
flagged
 
negative
 
documents.
 
Rejection
 
Mechanisms
 
RAR
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
simple
 
rejection
 
criteria
 
and
 
supports
 
flexible
 
threshold
 
configuration
 
to
 
adjust
 
moderation
 
strictness.
 
Count-based
 
thresholds
 
can
 
reject
 
the
 
user
 
query
 
if
 
at
 
least
 
N
 
negative
 
documents
 
appear
 
in
 
the
 
top-k
 
retrieved
 
documents
 
(e.g.,
 
reject
 
if
 
2
 
negatives
 
appear
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
5).
 
Rank-based
 
thresholds
 
reject
 
any
 
negative
 
document
 
appearing
 
within
 
the
 
top-N
 
retrieved
 
documents
 
(e.g.,
 
reject
 
if
 
any
 
negative
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
3
 
results).
 
Score-based
 
thresholds
 
reject
 
if
 
the
 
mean
 
reciprocal
 
rank
 
(MRR)
 
or
 
similarity
 
score
 
of
 
negative
 
documents
 
exceeds
 
a
 
certain
 
threshold.
 
These
 
thresholds
 
can
 
be
 
tuned
 
to
 
the
 
application’s
 
tolerance
 
for
 
risk.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
conservative
 
setting
 
might
 
reject
 
if
 
any
 
negative
 
document
 
appears
 
(N=1),
 
whereas
 
a
 
looser
 
setting
 
might
 
require
 
multiple
 
negatives
 
or
 
a
 
high
 
similarity
 
score.
 
Because
 
the
 
retrieval
 
step
 
is
 
already
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
RAG
 
pipeline,
 
adjusting
 
these
 
rules
 
adds
 
no
 
runtime
 
overhead.
 
2.2.
 
Experimental
 
Setup
 
To
 
evaluate
 
RAR,
 
we
 
tested
 
on
 
HarmfulQA
 
[10]
,
 
a
 
collection
 
of
 
1960
 
potentially
 
harmful
 
user
 
queries
 
and
 
conversations
 
from
 
10
 
different
 
topics
 
("Business
 
and
 
Economics",
 
"Education
 
and
 
Pedagogy",
  
"Geography
 
and
 
Environmental
 
Studies",
 
"Health
 
and
 
Medicine",
 
"History
 
and
 
Culture",
 
"Literature
 
and
 
Language",
 
"Mathematics
 
and
 
Logic",
 
"Philosophy
 
and
 
Ethics",
 
"Science
 
and
 
Technology",
 
"Social
 
Sciences")
 
and
 
98
 
subtopics.
 
For
 
each
 
subtopic,
 
we
 
leveraged
 
an
 
unrestricted
 
LLM
 
(i.e.,
 
Deepseek
 
R1
 
abliterated)
 
to
 
generate
 
a
 
3
 


 
negative
 
document
 
that
 
narratively
 
describes
 
the
 
malicious
 
intent
 
behind
 
the
 
unsafe
 
questions.
 
Similarly,
 
we
 
also
 
included
 
synthetic
 
positive
 
documents.
 
This
 
mirrors
 
a
 
real
 
knowledge
 
base
 
where
 
most
 
content
 
is
 
benign
 
but
 
includes
 
decoys.

A

to

(Llama

We
 
selected
 
Claude
 
as
 
the
 
LLM
 
baseline
 
based
 
on
 
findings
 
from
 
the
 
Or-Bench
 
benchmark
 
[11]
,
 
which
 
shows
 
a
 
strong
 
refusal
 
behaviour
 
in
 
Anthropic
 
models,
 
making
 
them
 
a
 
conservative
 
point
 
of
 
comparison.
 
Models
 
have
 
been
 
compared
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
rejection
 
accuracy
 
(i.e.,
 
proportion
 
of
 
unsafe
 
requests
 
correctly
 
blocked),
 
true
 
positive
 
rate
 
(i.e.,
 
proportion
 
of
 
safe
 
requests
 
correctly
 
whitelisted),
 
false
 
negative
 
rate
 
(i.e.,
 
proportion
 
of
 
unsafe
 
requests
 
getting
 
through),
 
and
 
F1
 
score.
 
Since
 
RAR
 
is
 
completely
 
compatible
 
with
 
already
 
existing
 
LLM
 
pipelines,
 
we
 
also
 
tested
 
the
 
concatenation
 
of
 
RAR
 
and
 
Claude,
 
reported
 
as
 
RAR+LLM.
 
We
 
first
 
apply
 
RAR,
 
and
 
only
 
if
 
RAR
 
does
 
not
 
reject,
 
we
 
pass
 
the
 
query
 
to
 
the
 
Claude
 
LLM
 
to
 
check
 
its
 
response.
 
This
 
simulates
 
using
 
RAR
 
as
 
a
 
first
 
filter
 
before
 
the
 
standard
 
guardrail.

Results
 
and
 
Discussion
 
The
 
simplicity
 
and
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
RAR
 
can
 
be
 
easily
 
understood
 
by
 
inspecting
 
two
 
simple
 
quantitative
 
metrics
 
derived
 
from
 
negative
 
document
 
retrieval:
 
the
 
number/proportion
 
of
 
retrieved
 
negative
 
documents
 
and
 
the
 
position
 
of
 
the
 
highest-ranked
 
negative
 
document.
 
The
 
density
 
kernel
 
estimation
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
features
 
on
 
the
 
test
 
set
 
is
 
illustrated
 
in
 
Figure
 
2,
 
showing
 
a
 
clear
 
separation
 
between
 
safe
 
and
 
unsafe
 
user
 
queries
 
over
 
these
 
two
 
directions.
 
Based
 
on
 
these
 
results,
 
we
 
set
 
the
 
rejection
 
thresholds
 
for
 
RAR,
 
respectively,
 
to
 
0.5
 
for
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
retrieved
 
negative
 
documents
 
and
 
1
 
for
 
the
 
highest
 
ranked
 
negative
 
document.
 
However,
 
the
 
thresholds
 
can
 
be
 
adjusted
 
using
 
different
 
computed
 
features
 
and
 
optimized
 
for
 
different
 
profile
 
risks.
 
Figure

shows
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
a
 
possible
 
optimization
 
based
 
on
 
F1
 
(suitable
 
for
 
balanced
 
profile
 
risks),
 
rejection
 
accuracy
 
(suitable
 
for
 
high-risk
 
applications),
 
and
 
true
 
positive
 
rate
 
(suitable
 
for
 
low-risk
 
settings).

Separation
 
between
 
safe
 
and
 
unsafe
 
user
 
requests
 
is
 
well-defined
 
for
 
both
 
metrics,
 
allowing
 
rejection
 
of
 
inputs
 
simply
 
by
 
setting
 
appropriate
 
thresholds.

The
 
performance
 
of
 
RAR
 
against
 
the
 
moderation
 
baselines
 
on
 
the
 
HarmfulQA
 
test
 
set
 
has
 
been
 
reported
 
in
 
Table
 
2.
 
Off-the-shelf
 
encoder-based
 
detectors
 
did
 
not
 
recognize
 
the
 
subtle
 
malicious
 
intent
 
in
 
any
 
HarmfulQA
 
questions,
 
completely
 
failing
 
the
 
task.
 
We
 
excluded
 
this
 
comparison
 
from
 
the
 
table.
 
A
 
detailed,
 
topic-wise
 
evaluation
 
on
 
rejection
 
accuracy
 
is
 
illustrated
 
in
 
Figure
 
4.
 
 
These
 
results
 
suggest
 
that
 
the
 
negative
 
document
 
retrieval
 
signal
 
is
 
a
 
powerful
 
indicator
 
of
 
malicious
 
intent.
 
Remarkably,
 
RAR
 
catches
 
many
 
unsafe
 
queries
 
that
 
the
 
Claude
 
guardrail
 
misses.
 
This
 
aligns
 
with
 
observations
 
in
 
RAG
 
security.
 
Even
 
when
 
users
 
attempt
 
to
 
obfuscate
 
intent,
 
the
 
negative
 
documents
 
still
 
trigger
 
due
 
to
 
shared
 
semantics.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
the
 
LLM’s
 
refusal
 
relies
 
on
 
the
 
model’s
 
understanding
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
more
 
easily
 
fooled
 
by
 
slight
 
rewordings.
 
Here,
 
these
 
considerations
 
are
 
flipped
 
and
 
used
 
defensively.
 
RAR
 
appears
 
to
 
be
 
beneficial
 
mainly
 
for
 
topics
 
like
 
education
 
and
 
pedagogy,
 
geography
 
and
 
environmental
 
studies,
 
and
 
science
 
and
 
technology.
 
LLMs
 
and
 
RAR
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
concatenated
 
to
 
further
 
improve
 
rejection
 
accuracy
 
and
 
reduce
 
the
 
false
 
negative
 
rate.
 
 
RAR’s
 
aggressive
 
matching
 
can
 
introduce
 
false
 
positives:
 
about
 
26%
 
of
 
safe
 
queries
 
were
 
blocked.
 
However,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
a
 
conservative
 
threshold
 
setup,
 
and
 
softer
 
trade-offs
 
can
 
be
 
obtained
 
by
 
optimizing
 
metrics
 
like
 
F1.
 
Importantly,
 
RAR’s
 
rejections
 
are
 
explainable.
 
This
 
transparency
 
is
 
an
 
advantage
 
over
 
opaque
 
classifier
 
judgments.
 
Also,
 
updating
 
RAR
 
is
 
simple:
 
if
 
the
 
moderator
 
finds
 
that
 
some
 
harmless
 
queries
 
are
 
being
 
rejected,
 
one
 
can
 
add
 
or
 
refine
 
positive
 
documents,
 
or
 
adjust
 
the
 
threshold.
 
Conversely,
 
if
 
a
 
new
 
type
 
of
 
harmful
 
query
 
5
 


 
emerges
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
novel
 
scam),
 
we
 
can
 
generate
 
a
 
corresponding
 
negative
 
document
 
immediately.
 
This
 
flexibility
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
contrast
 
to
 
fixed
 
filter
 
models.

Conclusion
 
RAR
 
introduces
 
a
 
novel
 
moderation
 
paradigm
 
that
 
transforms
 
a
 
known
 
vulnerability
 
in
 
retrieval-augmented
 
systems
 
into
 
a
 
powerful
 
yet
 
simple
 
defense
 
mechanism.
 
By
 
injecting
 
flagged
 
negative
 
documents
 
into
 
the
 
vector
 
store
 
and
 
rejecting
 
any
 
query
 
that
 
retrieves
 
them,
 
RAR
 
enables
 
dynamic,
 
real-time
 
filtering
 
of
 
harmful
 
inputs
 
without
 
requiring
 
model
 
retraining
 
or
 
architectural
 
changes.
 
Our
 
experiments
 
show
 
that
 
RAR
 
outperforms
 
built-in
 
LLM
 
safety
 
layers
 
in
 
rejecting
 
unsafe
 
queries
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
tuned
 
flexibly
 
to
 
suit
 
application
 
needs.
 
Compared
 
to
 
traditional
 
content
 
filters
 
and
 
classifier-based
 
guardrails,
 
RAR
 
offers
 
two
 
major
 
advantages:
 
adaptability
 
and
 
transparency.
 
Its
 
rejection
 
behavior
 
can
 
be
 
modified
 
on
 
the
 
fly
 
simply
 
by
 
updating
 
documents
 
in
 
the
 
retrieval
 
index,
 
allowing
 
for
 
rapid
 
response
 
to
 
emerging
 
threats.
 
Moreover,
 
every
 
rejection
 
is
 
explainable:
 
moderators
 
can
 
trace
 
it
 
back
 
to
 
a
 
specific
 
triggering
 
document
 
and
 
understand
 
the
 
rationale
 
behind
 
it.
 
 
A
 
key
 
limitation
 
of
 
RAR
 
lies
 
in
 
coverage
 
completeness:
 
the
 
system
 
is
 
only
 
as
 
robust
 
as
 
its
 
negative
 
document
 
library.
 
Ensuring
 
comprehensive
 
coverage
 
of
 
harmful
 
intents
 
requires
 
either
 
careful
 
curation
 
or
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
uncensored
 
LLMs
 
to
 
automatically
 
generate
 
high-risk
 
decoys.
 
Future
 
work
 
could
 
explore
 
scalable
 
methods
 
for
 
harvesting
 
malicious
 
query
 
patterns
 
from
 
real-world
 
logs
 
or
 
employing
 
active
 
learning
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
negative
 
set
 
over
 
time.
 
Overall,
 
RAR
 
is
 
well
 
suited
 
for
 
high-risk
 
or
 
domain-specific
 
applications,
 
such
 
as
 
healthcare,
 
finance,
 
or
 
education,
 
where
 
new
 
forms
 
of
 
harmful
 
interaction
 
may
 
emerge
 
rapidly
 
and
 
demand
 
responsive
 
safeguards.
 
It
 
can
 
also
 
complement
 
existing
 
moderation
 
pipelines,
 
acting
 
as
 
a
 
lightweight
 
first-layer
 
filter.
 
Looking
 
ahead,
 
RAR’s
 
core
 
idea
 
could
 
extend
 
to
 
multimodal
 
retrieval
 
systems,
 
where
 
negative
 
examples
 
include
 
unsafe
 
images,
 
code,
 
or
 
audio
 
prompts.
 
It
 
may
 
also
 
integrate
 
with
 
adversarial
 
training,
 
contextual
 
prompt
 
filtering,
 
or
 
active
 
feedback
 
loops
 
to
 
strengthen
 
LLM
 
safety
 
end-to-end.
 
As
 
LLMs
 
become
 
increasingly
 
integrated
 
into
 
public
 
and
 
enterprise
 
systems,
 
safety
 
mechanisms
 
must
 
evolve
 
with
 
similar
 
speed
 
and
 
flexibility.
 
RAR
 
offers
 
a
 
compelling
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
safety
 
toolbox—simple
 
to
 
deploy,
 
explainable
 
by
 
design,
 
and
 
capable
 
of
 
adapting
 
to
 
threats
 
at
 
the
 
pace
 
they
 
arise.
