## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,
Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents
into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short
in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval
environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to
elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess
information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making
them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web
environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with
challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in
real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for
constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,
difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation
framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including
fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of
information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search
engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and
offers actionable insights for future research.

1 Introduction
Despite remarkable capabilities across various domains [ 25,11,23,19,24,46,50,53,59,56,55],
large language models (LLMs) still suffer from factual hallucinations [ 16,28], outdated knowl-
edge [ 12], and limited access to real-time information [ 40]. To address these challenges, Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) [ 4,5,62] has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to
enhance their responses with retrieved external information. RAG typically consists of three stages:
retrieval, augmentation, and generation [ 42,5]. The first two stages – retrieving relevant documents
and selecting useful evidence – constitute the information seeking process. While traditional RAG
systems rely on static workflows, recent advancements in Agentic RAG [ 42,39,37,14] integrate
autonomous LLM agents into the RAG pipeline, allowing for dynamic planning, search, and re-
flection to support more flexible and robust evidence acquisition. This paradigm has already been
integrated into real-world systems, including Deep Research features in OpenAI [ 33], Gemini [ 9],
and Perplexity [44], where agents iteratively search and synthesize information from the live web.
The introduction of the agent primarily transforms the information seeking process of RAG, while
the generation step remains largely unchanged, i.e., responds based on the external information.

Consequently, a core goal in evaluating Agentic RAG should be to assess the effectiveness of
agentic information seeking. Rigorous benchmarking and evaluation are essential to quantify these
improvements, identify potential weaknesses, and guide the development of more capable agentic
systems. However, existing RAG benchmarks are inadequate for this purpose, as shown in Figure 1.
Firstly, most benchmarks are constrained to static environment [ 58,2,27,43] with a fixed,
limited corpus . Such setups fail to reflect the scale and dynamic of real-world web environments,
characterized by massive document volume, content drift, URL decay, and frequent fluctuations in
search engine results. As a result, these benchmarks misalign with the operational complexity that
Agentic RAG systems must manage in deployment. Moreover, static benchmarks rely on pre-defining
ground-truth documents and traditional metrics such as NDCG [ 58]. In contrast, the open-ended
nature of the web makes it difficult to determine a gold evidence set in advance, rendering such
metrics inapplicable. This presents a significant challenge for evaluating the quality of information
seeking in dynamic environments. Secondly, existing benchmarks often fall short in terms of
question complexity. Many of their queries are relatively simple and can be answered directly by
LLMs with parametric knowledge or a single-turn search [ 48,20,43]. Such questions fail to elicit
core agentic behaviors, e.g., planning, multi-turn tool use, and reasoning over multiple pieces of
evidence, so they cannot meaningfully evaluate the effectiveness of agentic information seeking.
To address the above limitations, we propose InfoDeepSeek , a benchmark with challenging ques-
tions and novel evaluation metrics tailored for agentic information seeking under real-world web
environments. First, we introduce a set of criteria and a systematic methodology for constructing
challenging queries aimed at evaluating agentic information seeking. We manually curate and validate
245 high-quality questions, each carefully designed to exhibit the following properties:
•Determinacy : Each question has a clear, unique, and temporally stable answer.
•Difficulty : The questions are intentionally challenging for LLMs, even with single-turn web
search. This highlights the need for multi-turn agentic information seeking capabilities
•Diversity : Questions cover various domains, predominant languages, and attributes, i.e.,
multi-hop, long-tail, freshness, time-sensitive, distracting information, and false premises.
Building on this, we develop an agentic information seeking system that integrates multiple search
and browsing tools in live web environments. Facing such a noisy and dynamic environment,
we propose a set of fine-grained evaluation metrics and protocols to dynamically assess the
effectiveness of information seeking. Our evaluation metrics include answer accuracy, information
accuracy, information compactness, and effective evidence utilization, offering a comprehensive
view of the agent’s information seeking ability. We further conduct empirical evaluations across
multiple dimensions, including different LLMs, search engines, and question types, revealing agents’
behaviors under complex and dynamic environments. Our key contributions are as follows:
•We introduce a set of criteria and a systematic methodology for constructing challenging
queries and present a new benchmark, InfoDeepSeek, for evaluating agentic information
seeking in real-world settings. We believe these principles and methodologies are transfer-
able and can benefit the research community of benchmarking AI agents for RAG.

•We propose an Agentic RAG framework coupled with the first fine-grained evaluation
metrics and protocols that assess information seeking effectiveness in dynamic environments.
•We provide a comprehensive comparison of agents under different LLMs, search engines,
and question types, identifying their limitations and outlining directions for future research.
2 Related Work
Agentic RAG . RAG has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the factual accuracy and timeliness
of LLMs [ 4,5,62,22,38,52,49,63]. To overcome the limitations of traditional RAG systems – which
rely on static workflows and often struggle with complex tasks [ 42] – the Agentic RAG paradigm
has introduced agents into the RAG pipeline [ 42,39,37,14,21,61]. These agents enable multi-turn,
in-depth, and dynamic information seeking, enhancing the system’s performance and adaptability
in complex scenarios. Notably, this paradigm has begun to see increasing adoption in practical
applications [ 33,9,44],e.g., Deep Research from OpenAI [ 33], Gemini [ 9], and Perplexity [ 44], all
employing agents to support users in completing multi-step information seeking tasks.

RAG Benchmarks . Early RAG researches rely on QA benchmarks, e.g., NQ [ 20], TriviaQA [ 18],
and MS MARCO [ 30], for evaluation. With the rapid advancement of LLMs’ knowledge, recent
RAG benchmarks for factual QA have begun to shift focus toward more challenging scenarios and
tasks, e.g., multi-source information [ 2,58], noise [ 2], multi-hop reasoning [ 43,15,47], long-tail
knowledge [ 58,13], long document [ 36], and temporally evolving answers [ 48,2]. Nevertheless,
as illustrated in Table 1, most benchmarks still rely on static environments with limited corpora or
limited question complexity and diversity [ 58,2,43,20]. In contrast, our work focuses on evaluating
agents’ information seeking abilities in dynamic, real-world settings, with challenging questions.
The evaluation of RAG involves information seeking and generation stages [ 38]. Most benchmarks
include assessing generation quality, i.e., answer accuracy [ 51,58,2,54,48,43,64]. Some works
evaluate information seeking quality, but they all employ retrieval metrics in static settings with pre-
defined ground-truth documents [ 43,27,38], which is not applicable in dynamic environments without
fixed ground-truth documents. Thus, we propose a new evaluation framework for information seeking
quality in dynamic settings, incorporating dimensions like relevance, utility, and compactness.
3 Problem Formulation and Agentic RAG Framework
Given a user query q∈ Q , the goal of Agentic RAG is to acquire a set of evidence C=
{c1, c2,···, cnq}of length nqby iteratively searching and browsing within an open environment,
and to generate an response ˆyqthat closely approximates the groundtrue answer yq. Following the
three-stage framework of RAG [ 42],i.e., retrieval, augmentation, and generation, we implement
an Agentic RAG system tailored for real-world web environments. Note that we mainly focus on
benchmarking the information seeking process ( i.e., the retrieval and augmentation stage), as it is the
primary component transformed by the introduction of LLM agents into the RAG pipeline.
Retrieval Stage . Upon receiving the input query q, the agent initiates a planning process π0=Plan(q)
about how to seek information from the web. The agent then launches an information seeking
trajectory of up to Tsteps. At each step t, the agent reflects on the current observation otand its
memory ( i.e., previous trajectory) ht, and updates its plan πt+1=Reflect (ot, ht, πt). Based on the
plan, it selects tools ( e.g., search engines, browser, time-related utilities, or termination) and performs

Here we support some mainstream search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and
Selenium-based web browsing. This information seeking loop continues until the agent has sufficient
information to terminate or hits the step limit T. This stage generates a sequence of observations
O={o1, o2,···, oT}, representing retrieved contents from the web.
Augmentation Stage . Given the potential volume and noise of retrieved content in the previous stage,
the agent performs content filtering and distillation. It selects and summarizes the most relevant
documents, yielding a focused set of evidence C=SelectRelevant (q, O). The agent will determine
the size nqof the set Cand sort the evidence in Cby importance. Usually, we only stipulate that nq
does not exceed a maximum number n, usually n= 5following previous works [34].
Generation Stage . Finally, the agent generates a response ˆyqbased on the curated content Cand
query q,i.e.,ˆyq=Generate (q, C). More details about our framework are provided in Appendix A
4 Dataset Construction
This section outlines the criteria and methodology we use to construct a challenging dataset for
evaluating an agent’s information-seeking abilities. See Appendix B for more details.
4.1 Criteria for Query
Determinacy and Verifiability . Unlike static RAG settings with a fixed corpus and information,
real-world environments have constantly changing information. Thus, questions in this context must
preserve stability and verifiability to allow consistent and reliable evaluation. Thus, we collect factual
questions with a clear, unambiguous, and time-invariant answer that can be verified through publicly
available web sources. This ensures robust evaluation even in dynamic environments.
Difficulty . If a question can be solved with LLMs’ internal knowledge or LLMs with one-turn
search, it fails to activate the real abilities of agents. Hence, we focus on questions that LLMs cannot
answer with a single-turn search. To enforce this constraint, we apply difficulty filtering and exclude
questions that mainstream LLMs ( e.g., GPT-4o [ 17] and DeepSeek-R1 [ 10]) can already answer
correctly with a single-turn search. Furthermore, we incorporate various difficulty attributes and
present their definition and ratios in our benchmark in Table 2. Note that a question can contain
multiple attributes, so the sum of their ratios is not 1.
Diversity in Attributes, Domains, and Predominant Languages . Each query is constructed to
capture a combination of at least two of the attributes in Table 2, ensuring coverage of real-world
information seeking challenges. We also ensure domain diversity, including but not limited to sports,
politics, science, history, geography, music, literature, art, film, gaming, and news. Besides, we
consider the predominant language, cases where accurate information is more readily available in
a particular language. While all questions in our dataset are provided in both English and Chinese,
we include queries whose answers are primarily documented in other languages such as Japanese,
4

French, Korean, Italian, or Icelandic. This encourages more realistic, language-aware search behavior
from the agent and creates additional challenges due to the multilingual nature of the web.

4.2 Methodology for Dataset Construction
To operationalize the aforementioned criteria, we develop a set of practical heuristics and workflows
for query generation as shown in Figure 2. We begin by extracting knowledge from web sources,
based on which we produce draft questions. These draft questions are then subjected to two key
filtering stages: determinacy check and difficulty check. Questions that pass both filters are retained
as candidates, and subsequently go through a multi-stage validation process. Through iterative
annotation and refinement, we have developed a set of practical methodologies and guidelines that
produce questions aligned with our criteria. See Appendix B for more details.
Fact-Grounded Query Drafting. To guarantee that each question has a verifiable answer, annota-
tors are encouraged to adopt a reverse construction strategy – starting from known knowledge in
authoritative and diverse web sources, and formulating a question with a unique answer. Annotators
are required to reference credible web content, such as official websites, academic publications, or
multilingual Wikipedia entries, to validate both factual correctness and answer uniqueness.
Expand from Anchor Knowledge. During the data collection, we observed that many seemingly
complex questions, involving multi-hop reasoning, emerging facts, temporal sensitivity, or false
premises, could still be solved by LLMs based on their knowledge or single-round search. To address
this, we identify anchor knowledge, usually long-tail knowledge and distracting information , which
are hard for LLMs to answer correctly without deeper search. Many such anchors can be derived
from low-resource or non-mainstream language sources. Once we find one or more difficult anchors,
we further compound their complexity by composing them with more ordinary knowledge or by
linking them to additional difficulty attributes. In this way, these questions not only require deeper
retrieval but also demand planning, disambiguation, and reasoning across noisy or obscure content.
Diversification. To enhance the coverage of our dataset, we adopt a proactive strategy in diversifying
queries. Annotators are guided to contribute questions targeting less frequently covered attributes,
domains, or predominant languages. Besides, starting from anchor knowledge, we can introduce
multi-hop reasoning that links to new attributes, domains, or languages. For example, given a long-tail
fact about the founders of Saratov State Agrarian University, we might explore the founder’s other
identities (e.g., agronomist, political leader) to connect it to different domains. This compositional
approach allowed us to systematically increase both the complexity and the diversity of our dataset.
Determinacy and Difficulty Filtering . In the determinacy check, each draft question undergoes
cross-referencing against multiple independent sources to verify the correctness of the answer.
Annotators ensure that (1) the answer is uniquely correct given the query, and (2) the answer is not
time-sensitive or prone to change over time. For difficulty check, we evaluate each draft question
with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 in a web-enabled, single-turn search setting. If both models answer
the question correctly, we discard the question. This ensures that only those challenging queries
requiring deeper information seeking behavior are retained for the benchmark.
Multi-Stage Validation for Reliability. To ensure data quality and compliance with our criteria,
each question undergoes a two-stage review process. Each query is independently verified by two
annotators, who assess its correctness, determinacy, difficulty, and normativity . A third adjudicator
then makes the final decision regarding whether the question is eligible for inclusion.
For each verified question q, we record its ground-truth answer yq, the supporting source webpages
Sq, and annotated metadata, e.g., difficulty attribute, domain, and predominant language. With the
5

efforts of seven annotators, we collected 245 validated data entries, covering 14 domains and 19
predominant languages . More details about data statistics are provided in Appendix B.4.
5 Metrics and Evaluation
This section introduces our evaluation framework, with more detail presented in Appendix C.
5.1 Metrics
Here, we define four core metrics, assessing not only final answer accuracy but also agents’ informa-
tion seeking capabilities to search, extract, and prioritize relevant information from noisy sources.
We denote the answer generation stage as ϕ(·,·), usually implemented by an LLM.
Answer Accuracy (ACC) refers to whether the answer generated based on all the observations
Omatches the groundtrue answer yq, that is ACC =P
q∈QI(ϕ(q, O) =yq)/|Q|, where I(·)is
indicator function to determine whether ϕ(q, O)andyqare the same, implemented by a judge LLM
in Section 5.2. This is a coarse-grained correctness metric without considering augmentation stage.
Information Accuracy (IA@k) measures quality of evidence obtained by information seeking
process. In open web environments, predefining ground-truth documents is infeasible due to content
volatility and source multiplicity, and multi-hop questions may involve different information sources.
Instead, we evaluate the evidence quality by dynamically assessing whether the top- kevidence of C
from the augmentation stage is sufficient to answer the question. Specifically, we generate an answer
from the top- kevidence C1:k,i.e.,ϕ(q, C1:k), and compute IA@k =P
q∈QI(ϕ(q, C1:k) =yq)/|Q|.
A higher RA@k implies better evidence relevance.
Effective Evidence Utilization (EEU) measures the agent’s ability to extract relevant information
from the noisy observations Oand form the evidence set C. It is defined as the ratio between the
best achievable accuracy across all top- ksubsets ( k= 1,···, n) and the answer accuracy with
all observations, i.e.,EEU =max 1≤k≤nIA@k
ACC. EEU significantly below 1 suggests that the agent’s
evidence selection is suboptimal, and that key information is either buried or omitted.
Information Compactness (IC) quantifies the information density of evidence set C. An ideal agent
should gather concise, high-quality evidence with minimal noise or redundancy. We first define the
information compactness for each query, IC q, as:
ICq=nq/|Sq|, if∃k≤nqsuch that ϕ(q, C1:k) =yq
(n+b)/|Sq|,otherwise, i.e., answer failures
where nq=|C|denotes the length of evidence set (up to a maximum n),Sqis the human-annotated
standard set of source webpages required to answer the query, and bis a penalty constant (typically
b= 1) for answer failures. With ICq, IC can be defined as IC=P
q∈QICq/|Q|.IC<1suggests
that the agent either found compact sources (covering multiple hops) or successfully leveraged prior
knowledge to reduce evidence dependency. IC>1implies over-retrieval or poor evidence filtering
with the presence of redundant or irrelevant content, even though they answer the question correctly.
5.2 Evaluation
Our proposed metrics highly rely on determining whether the LLM-generated answer, ϕ(q, C1:k)
andϕ(q, O), semantically and factually aligns with the groundtrue answer yq. Prior work has
demonstrated that LLM-based evaluators can closely approximate human judgment in factual
QA [ 58,57]. Following these findings, we adopt both human evaluation ( human-eval ) and LLM-
based automatic evaluation ( auto-eval ) to assess the agreement between answers. Specifically, we
mainly employ two LLM evaluators, DeepSeek-V3 ( deepseek-chat ) [3] and Gemini-2.0-Flash
(gemini-2.0-flash-preview-04-07 ) [6], to reduce self-preference bias [ 35], following [ 58].
If the two evaluators produce conflicting judgments, we resort to a third arbiter, GPT-4o-mini
(gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 ) [31]) or a human annotator, and report the majority vote decision.
While LLM-based evaluation is generally reliable, we observe a common failure mode on false
premise questions, where LLM evaluators often fail to identify incorrect assumptions in the query.
6

To mitigate this issue, we explicitly annotate such groundtrue answers yqwith statements like “This
question contains a false premise: ... ” , making the premise violation explicit. Additionally, we
design separate evaluation prompts for false-premise and other questions to encourage evaluators to
condition their judgment appropriately. In our experiments, this strategy improves LLMs’ evaluation
accuracy from 95.57% to 99.29% compared with human-eval. See Appendix C.2 for more details.
6 Benchmarking Agentic Information Seeking
6.1 Experiment Setup
We evaluate a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs under our Agentic RAG framework,
including GPT-4o ( gpt-4o-2024-08-06 ) [17], o3-mini ( o3-mini-2025-01-31 ) [32], Claude-3.7-
Sonnet (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 ) [1], DeepSeek-V3 ( deepseek-chat ) [26], DeepSeek-
R1 (deepseek-reasoner ) [10], Gemini-2.5-Flash ( gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 ) [7],
Gemini-2.5-Pro ( gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 ) [8], Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct [ 29],
and Qwen3-32B [ 45]. For Qwen3-32B, we test both its thinking mode (Qwen3-32B w/ think) and
non-thinking mode (Qwen3-32B w/o think). Unless otherwise specified, the maximum step Tof
retrieval stage is 5, and the maximum length of evidence set Cin augmentation stage is 5 ( n= 5), as
the length of supporting source webpages Sqtypically ranges from 1 to 3. The default search engine
is DuckDuckGo, due to its open accessibility. See Appendix D.1 for more details.
During our experiments, when evaluating a specific LLM, we use this LLM across all stages, including
retrieval, augmentation, and answer generation for computing ACC and IA@k, i.e.,ϕ(·,·). We also
explore the impact of different answer LLMs for ϕ(·,·), where information seeking and generation
use different LLMs. These results are provided in Appendix D.6.

6.2 Benchmarking on Different LLMs, Search Engines, and Question Attributes
Different LLMs . Table 3 presents the performance of agents based on various LLMs on our
benchmark, InfoDeepSeek, highlighting the challenge it presents for agentic information seeking
tasks. Firstly, SOTA LLMs perform suboptimally on the agentic information seeking tasks.
The best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 22.45% on ACC and 21.63% on IA@5.
This result underscores the complexity of the tasks, as even the strongest model struggles to provide
accurate answers across our challenging queries. Secondly, LLMs optimized for reasoning and
information retrieval outperform others. DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, and O3-mini
outperforms GPT-4o, indicating that reasoning models tend to perform better in agentic information
seeking. Additionally, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Pro, which are specifically optimized for
search and deep research scenarios, show better performance compared to other models.
In terms of information quality (IA@ k), most models perform poorly on IA@1, as many queries
require multiple sources to provide a correct answer. A single document is often insufficient to
fully address the question. As kincreases, we observe a trend of initial improvement followed
by a decline. This is likely due to the influence of irrelevant or distracting information from later
retrieved sources, highlighting the importance of effective augmentation in selecting relevant evidence.
Effective Evidence Utilization (EEU) is mostly below 1, indicating that most LLMs struggle to extract
useful evidence from the vast amount of information retrieved during the retrieval stage. Regarding
7

information compactness (IC), most models exhibit significant redundancy in their responses. This is
largely due to the low success rate of retrieval and the increased reliance on irrelevant information.
Models with higher success rates typically exhibit lower redundancy, suggesting that reducing
irrelevant evidence through better information extraction is critical for improving performance.

Different Search Engines . To better understand the effect of different search engines on information
seeking performance, we conduct controlled experiments by fixing the agent and varying the search
engine. Specifically, Table 4 presents results for two representative LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini-
2.5-Flash, under four search engines: DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Firstly, search
engine significantly affects the performance of agentic information seeking . Google and Yahoo
consistently outperform Bing and DuckDuckGo, with DuckDuckGo yielding the lowest scores. This
highlights the importance of search engine quality in supporting effective agentic infromation seeking.
General-purpose search engines, e.g., Google and Yahoo, provide broader coverage and higher-quality
results, making them better suited as information entry for Agentic RAG systems. Secondly, a good
search engine can partially compensate for model limitations . While DeepSeek-V3 generally
underperforms Gemini-2.5-Flash in information seeking tasks, its performance improves substantially
when paired with Google, achieving an ACC of 28.57%, which narrows the gap with Gemini. This
suggests that access to higher-quality retrieval results is especially beneficial for models with weaker
reasoning capabilities. Interestingly, EEU tends to be higher when using DuckDuckGo. However,
this may be an artifact of poor retrieval quality: when most retrieved content is irrelevant, identifying
even a small number of useful pieces can lead to a higher utilization rate. This further underscores
the importance of selecting strong evidence sources to support robust answer generation.

Figure 3: Performance of LLMs and search engines across different question attributes.
Different Question Attributes. To further understand where agents succeed or struggle, we analyze
performance across different question attributes. Figures 3(a) and (b) show the performance of
different LLMs under DuckDuckGo, while Figure 3(c) presents results of DeepSeek-V3 with different
search engines. More results are available in Appendix D.2. Firstly, LLMs and search engines
consistently perform better on simpler attributes ,e.g., false premise, time sensitivity, and freshness,
and worse on multi-hop, long-tail, and distracting information questions. This aligns with our
observations during data collection, long-tail and distracting questions often contain obscure entities,
which are inherently difficult to agentic information seeking. Multi-hop questions in our benchmark
are frequently compositional, often combining long-tail and distracting information, compounding
their difficulty. Secondly, reasoning-enhanced LLMs show clear advantages over base models,
8

but these gains are primarily observed on the simpler question attributes. On harder attributes
like multi-hop or long-tail, LLMs’ ( e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini-Pro) performance improvements
are marginal. This suggests that current LLMs, even those optimized for reasoning, are still heavily
bottlenecked by retrieval quality and web information noise, particularly when facing sparse or
misleading information. Lastly, Google leads to more balanced and robust performance across
attributes, indicating that Google has higher information coverage and relevance. Together, these
findings highlight that while LLMs and agent capabilities are essential, retrieval source quality
remains a dominant factor in addressing complex information seeking tasks.

Figure 4: Performance with different maximum step Tof information seeking.
Test-time Scaling for Agentic Information Seeking . One of the key characteristics of an agent
is that its performance scales with respect to the amount of compute available during test time. To
investigate this, we allocate different levels of computational resources to the agent by varying the
maximum step Tin the retrieval stage from 1 to 20, and present the results in Figure 4. As shown in
the figure, both models demonstrate significant improvements in ACC, IA@k, and IC as Tincreases,
indicating clear scaling effects. This suggests that the agent’s performance can be enhanced by
scaling up the test-time computing for information seeking , with the ability to refine its search
and gather more evidence as additional computation is allocated. See Appendix D.3 for more details.
Retrieval Interference . In our experiments, we observe a notable phenomenon where certain
questions can be answered correctly by an LLM with its parametric knowledge, but the same model
fails to answer them after performing web-based retrieval . We refer to this behavior as retrieval
interference, where external information introduces confusion or distracts the model from its original
correct reasoning. To quantify this effect, we define a metric called the interference rate , which is
the fraction of questions that an LLM answers correctly without retrieval but answers incorrectly
after retrieval, normalized by the total questions it initially answered correctly without retrieval.
Figure 5(a) shows the interference rates of DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini-2.5-Flash across different
search engines. We find that retrieval interference is widespread, suggesting that low-quality or
tangentially relevant web content can often override or dilute the model’s internal confidence, leading
to degraded performance. To mitigate this issue, future systems should explore methods to preserve
model confidence in accurate internal knowledge and develop more precise retrieval strategies that
avoid introducing misleading information. See Appendix D.4 for more results and potential solutions.
Impact of Language . We also investigate the impact of languages on agentic information seeking
process. For Chinese andEnglish , we employ Chinese and English versions of prompts and queries.
Our experiments reveal that the search keywords used by LLMs to query search tools are strongly
aligned with the language of the input. For predominant languages , we face challenges in directly
converting prompts and queries to their respective language versions. Thus, we adopt a language-
aware prompt that explicitly instructs the agent to use the predominant language during the retrieval
stage (Appendix D.5). The results in Figure 5(b) demonstrate several important trends. First, English
consistently outperforms Chinese across most metrics. This is likely due to the broader coverage of
English-language content and search tools. Second, predominant language prompts yield the best
results. This suggests that leveraging a language-aware retrieval strategy improves the agent’s ability
to access and utilize high-quality, domain-relevant content.

7 Conclusion & Limitations
This work introduces InfoDeepSeek, a novel benchmark for evaluating agentic information seeking
in dynamic web environments, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks confined to a static
environment and simple queries. We propose a methodology for constructing challenging queries
that satisfy the criteria of determinacy, difficulty, and diversity. Furthermore, we design fine-grained
evaluation metrics tailored for the comprehensive assessment of agentic information seeking under
dynamic environments. However, our current dataset relies on manual construction, which is costly
and time-consuming. In future work, we plan to explore an automated data collection approach with
manual verification to lower costs and expand the dataset.

A Agentic Information Seeking Framework
To enable complex, multi-step information seeking in open-domain environments, we design a
generalizable Agentic RAG framework composed of modular components for planning, memory,
tool use, and generation. The agent is instantiated around a large language model (LLM), augmented
with external tools and reflection capabilities to support iterative decision-making and information
seeking.
A.1 Components
We begin by explaining the roles of LLMs, the memory bank, and the tool library. Subsequently,
these components will be integrated into the primary agent loop.
LLMs . The LLM serves as the agent’s central reasoning engine. It is responsible for interpreting
the user query, generating search plans, selecting tools, reflecting on past actions, filtering retrieved
content, and synthesizing the final answer. Our framework supports a variety of LLMs, including
both API-accessible remote models and locally hosted open-source models. To accommodate the
varying requirements of different LLMs, we introduce a straightforward API calling that accepts
a prompt as input and returns a response. All agents follow a unified interface that incorporates
structured planning and reflection mechanisms: at each step, the agent is prompted to explicitly plan
its next action and reflect on prior steps to refine its strategy. This iterative planning-reflection loop
enhances the agent’s adaptability to noisy or ambiguous web content.
Memory . The memory stores the evolving trajectory of the agent’s interaction with the web envi-
ronment. Concretely, it includes (1) all past plans generated by the agent, (2) actions such as tool
invocations and search queries, and (3) the corresponding observations retrieved from the web (e.g.,
snippets, page titles, contents). This memory is continuously updated and used as input to future
planning and reflection steps, enabling the agent to reason over previously collected evidence, avoid
redundancy, and refine its search strategy over time.
Tool Library . Tools serve as the agent’s interface to the external world. For our information seeking
agent, we support multiple real-time search engines, Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo, as well
as a Selenium-based browser tool that allows the agent to navigate, scroll, and extract content from
live webpages. In addition, we support time tool for time calculation that may be involved in queries
and webpages. This diverse toolset ensures robustness across query types and web content structures.
A.2 Retrieval Stage
The Retrieval Stage is responsible for actively exploring the web environment. The agent interacts
with external tools (e.g., search engines, browsers) through multi-step planning and decision-making
to acquire potentially relevant information. This stage emphasizes dynamic behavior: the agent
iteratively queries, observes, reflects, and adapts its strategy based on the evolving context.
Upon receiving the input query qfrom the user, the agent initiates an initial planning process
π0=Plan(q), which specifies its strategy for acquiring relevant information from the web. The agent
then launches an information seeking trajectory consisting of up to Titerative steps. At each step t, it
receives an observation otfrom the environment ( e.g., search results or web content), and updates its
internal plan by reflecting on the current observation otand memory ( i.e., previous trajectory) ht:
πt+1=Reflect (ot, ht, πt)
Based on the updated plan πt+1, the agent selects the next action using a tool from its available
set – such as a search engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo), a Selenium-based browser for
webpage exploration, or auxiliary tools like a time utility or stop action:
at+1=Act(πt+1)→ot+1
Each action yields an observation qt+1, typically the results of the tool, e.g., a snippet, webpage
content, or search result. This planning-action-reflection loop allows the agent to dynamically adapt
its strategy in response to retrieved evidence. The loop terminates either when the agent deems the
collected information sufficient or when the step limit Tis reached. The output of this stage is a
sequence of retrieved observations O={o1, o2,···, oT}, representing the raw web content gathered
during the search process. The detailed prompt of the retrieval stage is listed as follows:
16

You are a {agent_name}, {agent_bio}, {agent_instructions}
Currently, you are in the task planning phase, where you will
be given a specific query to address. Please utilize LLM’s
advantages and pursue efficient strategies for task planning.
1. You have a short-term memory of approximately 4,000
characters.
2. You do not require assistance or response from users.
3. You can use the reference tools mentioned when planning.
4. Complex problems can be split into sub-problems and then
information can be collected, aggregated and authenticated.
Be sure to verify the truthfulness of the information.
5. Stay humble and call the tool for questions you are
not sure about, but do not call the same tool with the same
parameters repeatedly.
6. You can think and plan up to {max_iter_num} steps, so
strive to plan tasks as efficiently as possible.
7. You have the capability for reflection and self-criticism;
reflect on past decisions and improve your strategies.
8. If you have sufficient information to answer the given
query, invoke the termination tool to terminate planning.
Otherwise, continue planning new tasks while ensuring no
duplication with prior tasks.
{tool_specification}
{current_date_and_time}
{memory}
Given Query: {query}
Based on the given question and existing tasks, plan a new
Task (no repetitions), and you can only generate the Task in
the following **JSON list** format:
[{
"task_name": "task description",
"command":{
"name":"command name",
"args":{
"arg name":"value"
}
}
}]
Even if there is only one task or no task, it needs to be
returned in the form of a list. Ensure that the Task can be
parsed by Python’s json.loads function.
If the completed Tasks are sufficient to answer the query,
terminate planning. Otherwise, create another Task that does
not duplicate previous ones.
A new Task:
A.3 Augmentation Stage
The Augmentation Stage focuses on filtering and organizing the retrieved content. Since web data
is often noisy, redundant, or only partially relevant, this stage distills the raw observations into a
compact, high-quality evidence set. It ensures that only the most pertinent information is retained for
answer generation, improving factual grounding and mitigating hallucinations.
Given the potentially large and noisy set of retrieved content O, the agent proceeds to filter and distill
this information into a more concise, relevant set. Specifically, it applies a selection function to
identify passages or documents that are most pertinent to answering the query:
17

C=SelectRelevant (q, O).
This process includes both document-level and span-level selection, ranking evidence based on
relevance, coverage, and redundancy. The resulting set C={c1, c2,·, cnq}is sorted by importance,
where nqis determined dynamically by the agent, subject to an upper bound n. This stage is
critical for reducing noise and focusing generation on high-quality information. The prompt for the
augmentation stage is as follows:
You are a {agent_name}, {agent_bio}, {agent_instructions}
The current stage is webpage ranking stage. In the previous
interactions, you have already found several webpages in
response to the user’s query. Now, you need to consolidate
this information and select the {max_webpage_num} most
relevant webpages, then rank them.
1. A webpage consists of a URL and webpage summary or
information extracted from the webpage that is relevant to
the query.
2. If multiple pieces of information come from the same
webpage (determined by identical URLs), merge them rather
than listing duplicates.
3. The output webpage list must include relevant webpages
necessary to answer the question. If the question has
multiple sub-questions, the relevant webpages of each
sub-question must be included.
4. The number of webpages in the output webpage list
can be less than {max_webpage_num}. If it is more than
{max_webpage_num}, select {max_webpage_num} of the most
important ones.
5. The output webpage list is sorted according to its
importance to answering the question, that is, the webpage
ranked first has the greatest contribution to answering the
question.
{current_date_and_time}
{memory}
Given Query: {query}
You must generate the list of webpages strictly in the
following **JSON list** format:
[{
"url": "The webpage 's URL",
"content": "Information extracted from the webpage that is
relevant to the given query", ,→
}]
Always return a list, even if there is no relevant web page,
you need to return an empty list to ensure that the task can
be parsed by Python’s json.loads
Relevant webpages (ranked by importance):
A.4 Generation Stage
The Generation Stage uses the refined evidence to produce a final response. Grounded in the selected
content, the language model synthesizes an answer that directly addresses the original query, ideally
with high factual accuracy and traceability. In the final stage, the agent generates an answer ˆyqbased
on the curated evidence set Cand the original query q. The generation function is typically a forward
pass through the LLM, grounded in the selected content:
ˆyq=Generate (C, q).
18

This answer reflects the agent’s ability to synthesize multiple sources of retrieved knowledge and
produce a coherent, factually accurate response.
You are {agent_name}, {agent_bio}, {agent_instructions}
Currently, you are in the question-answering stage. Based
on your own knowledge and relevant webpages, answer the given
query from the user.
1. If the user’s query contains multiple answers, list all of
them.
2. If the user’s query is based on a wrong premise, point out
the error.

B Dataset Construction
B.1 Query Generation
Our query construction pipeline consists of three key stages: draft generation, validation, and
annotation. This section outlines the practical methodology we adopt to ensure that the final queries
are factually grounded, sufficiently challenging for LLMs, and diverse across difficulty attributes,
domains, and languages.
B.1.1 Draft Question Generation.
We adopt a reverse construction strategy , where factual knowledge is first extracted from credible
sources and then transformed into a question that requires that knowledge (and possibly more) to
answer. The goal is to create queries that are multi-hop, complex, and grounded in long-tail or noisy
information. The main process proceeds as follows:
1.Anchor knowledge identification . Annotators begin by selecting an underrepresented
domain or language. They search authoritative sources such as Wikipedia, reputable news
sites, fact-checking platforms, expert forums, and academic databases to extract candidate
facts—particularly long-tail or distracting information, which we refer to as anchor knowl-
edge. Wikipedia’s link structure, category graphs, and multilingual variants are especially
helpful for uncovering obscure entities or facts. Some webpages present different content
across language versions; for example, Wikipedia entries in certain "advantage languages"
often contain more detailed information. Knowledge unique to low-resource or non-English
versions is more likely to be long-tail and underrepresented elsewhere.
2.Question composition . Based on the anchor knowledge, annotators either directly con-
struct a question or further increase question difficulty by incorporating multiple challenge
attributes or introducing additional domain-specific facts – either common or difficult –
through multi-hop composition. Compositionality is encouraged to ensure that the question
cannot be solved with shallow retrieval.
3.Temporal stability check . Annotators have to verify whether the answer varies with time.
For potentially unstable questions (e.g., “Who is the current president of the USA?”), we
explicitly add time constraints (e.g., “In 2025”) to ensure the answer remains fixed and
verifiable.
4.Diversity control . We aim for each question to include at least two difficulty attributes,
and for the dataset to span a wide range of domains, languages, and countries. Annotators
actively switch focus when certain attributes or domains become overrepresented.
19

B.1.2 Filtering and Refinement.
Each draft question undergoes a two-stage validation process to ensure that it meets both difficulty
and determinacy standards.
•Difficulty check . To ensure that a question cannot be answered by an LLM with internal
knowledge or single-turn search, we test it with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 with web access
enabled. If both models correctly answer the question in a single turn, the question is
discarded.
•Determinacy check . We verify the correctness and uniqueness of the answer using multi-
source cross-validation: (a) Searching and confirming the answer through multiple inde-
pendent web sources. (b) Leveraging links and citations provided by web-enabled LLMs
during difficulty filtering to trace and confirm factual accuracy. (c) Comparing content
across different language versions of the same source (e.g., multilingual Wikipedia pages)
to check for consistency and factual reliability.
B.1.3 Question Annotation.
For each validated question, we record:
• The Chinese and English versions of question q.
• The Chinese and English versions of ground-truth answer yq.
• The set of source webpages Sqthat provide the factual basis for the answer.
• Annotated metadata including difficulty attributes, domains, and predominant languages.
For multi-hop questions, we annotate the answer and evidence source for each reasoning step.
For false premise questions, we explicitly mark the flawed assumption in the answer using the
phrase: “This question contains a false premise: ...”, a format critical for subsequent automatic
evaluation. In addition, special attention should be paid to the translation of proper nouns, which
should be accurately translated based on online sources or annotated with their original names in the
predominant language.
B.2 Multi-stage Validation
B.2.1 Validation from Two Verifiers
To ensure the reliability and robustness of each constructed question, we implement a multi-stage
human verification process involving two independent annotators (verifiers). Each verifier is required
to evaluate the question from multiple perspectives. The validation process includes:
1.Content Verification : Check the correctness of the question and answer, and ensure that
the listed sources support the answer. Special attention is paid to the accuracy of proper
noun translations, which must be verified against online references or annotated using their
original names in the predominant language.
2.Criteria Check : Evaluate whether the question meets the required conditions: Determinacy
(Is the answer stable over time?) and Difficulty (Can GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 in a web-
enabled, single-turn search model correctly answer the question?) Regardless of whether
the question passes, the LLM responses are recorded in the validation notes for reference
during final review.
3.Metadata Verification : Ensure the correctness of annotated attributes, domain, and advan-
tage language.
4.Validation Outcome : Verifiers must fill out three fields: their name, a binary result
(pass/fail), and explanatory notes. A question is marked as passed only if it fully sat-
isfies all requirements (content, criteria, metadata). A fail may indicate outright rejection or
suggest that further review or correction is needed.
20

B.2.2 Final Decision
An additional decider makes the final decision based on the verification results from the two verifiers.
If both verifiers mark the question as valid, it is accepted directly. If either verifier marks it as invalid,
a third annotator conducts a further review, discarding questions that do not meet essential criteria
and correcting others where appropriate. This includes the following cases:
• Incorrect metadata: Fix and accept.
• Time-dependent Answer: Add a time constraint and re-validate with LLMs.
•Inaccurate answer: Replace with a correct one (confirmed by LLMs and sources) and accept.
• Ill-formed or ambiguous question: Reject.
•Inconsistent difficulty judgments: Since LLM behavior can vary, we accept questions if
at least three out of six LLMs (by the collector, two verifiers, each using two LLMs for
difficulty check) result in incorrect answers.
To ensure question quality, we invested substantial manual effort throughout the collection and
validation process. In total, seven annotators were involved in drafting questions, each of which
was further reviewed by two independent verifiers and a final decider. Due to the complexity,
cross-validation, and manual nature of our pipeline, we ultimately curated 245 high-quality questions.
Moving forward, we plan to expand the dataset and integrate more automation into the dataset
construction and validation pipeline to reduce cost and scale the collection of challenging, agent-
oriented queries.
B.3 Data Examples
Here, we provide two examples of our dataset. The first question exemplifies a challenging
combination of distracting information, long-tail knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning. To an-
swer it, one must first identify the president in question and then determine which university
awarded him a master’s degree, making it a classic multi-hop task. The query’s mention of
“a president who is a comedian” naturally points to Ukrainian President V olodymyr Zelensky,
and many search results indeed return Zelensky-related pages, demonstrating the presence of
strong distractors. However, the actual target is Jimmy Morales, former president of Guatemala.
His English Wikipedia entry ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Morales ) only notes
that he holds a master’s degree in strategic studies with a specialization in security and defense
from Mariano Gálvez University. Only by consulting less-common Spanish-language sources
(for example, an archived page at https://web.archive.org/web/20151028180235/http:
//www.jimmymorales.gt/main01/?page_id=2 ) can one discover that he also earned “a mas-
ter’s degree in media management from Universidad Panamericana de Guatemala.” This obscure
detail represents the long-tail information necessary to fully answer the question.

The second question illustrates a false-premise challenge. It asks: “Which composer was awarded
to the 2022 Grammy Awards Songwriter of the Year?” The underlying premise – that the Grammy
Award for Composer of the Year existed in 2022 – is false. In reality, this category was only
established in 2023. During the search, one will find references to the 2023 recipient, creating
additional noise and demonstrating how real-world information seeking can be misled by a question’s
incorrect assumptions.

B.4 Data Statistics
After rigorous drafting, refinement, and multi-stage verification by seven annotators, our dataset
comprises 245 high-quality queries, each exhibiting at least two of the following six difficulty
attributes: Multi-Hop, Long-Tail, Time-Sensitivity, Freshness, Distracting Information, False Premise.
The exact number of queries involving each attribute is reported in Table 5. Because most questions
combine two or more attributes, the total exceeds 245 when summed across attributes.
Table 5: The number of questions for each attribute. Time-Sen. denotes Time-Sensitive. Distr.Info.
means Distracting Information. False Prem. stands for False Premise.
Attributes Multi-Hop Long-Tail Time-Sen. Freshness Distr. Info. False Prem.
Numbers 188 187 162 48 76 27
We also ensured domain diversity by encouraging annotators to cover a wide range of topics. In
total, queries span 14 broad domains, including history, geography, film & TV , science & technology,
literature & art, politics, education, music, news, sports, humanities, entertainment, games, and
social sciences. For visualization, closely related subfields (e.g., astronomy, biology, medicine, and
computer science) are grouped under “science & technology,” while economics, sociology, and
law fall under “social sciences.” The question ratio of each domain is presented in Figure 6; since
multi-hop questions may touch multiple domains, the percentages sum to more than 100%.

Figure 6: The ratio of questions for different domains.
Finally, we annotated each query with its predominant language, the language in which relevant
evidence is most readily available. While English and Chinese are dominate, reflecting the abundance
of resources in these languages, our dataset also includes 17 less common predominant languages:
Japanese (11), Russian (9), Korean (8), Italian (6), Arabic (6), French (5), Spanish (4), German (3),
Portuguese (3), Icelandic (3), Slovene (3), Malay (2), Bengali (2), Croatian (1), Czech (1), Dutch
(1), and Hindi (1). This linguistic variety ensures that our benchmark challenges agents to perform
cross-lingual retrieval and to leverage non-English sources when appropriate, further broadening the
realism and difficulty of the tasks.
23

C Evaluation
To ensure reliable assessment of agent-generated answers, we adopt both human evaluation ( human-
eval) and automatic evaluation ( auto-eval ) using LLMs, each with carefully designed guidelines to
handle diverse question types, including those with false premises.
C.1 Human Evaluation
Human annotators are asked to determine whether the agent’s answer ˆyqcorrectly answers the given
question, with respect to the ground-truth answer yq. The evaluation guidelines emphasize the
following key aspects:
•Entity consistency : Ensure that events, people, and locations mentioned in the answer
match the ground truth.
•False premise detection : If the question contains a false assumption, the answer must
explicitly point it out.
•Answer completeness : If the question requires multiple pieces of information, all must be
answered correctly.
Each instance is independently annotated by two human raters, and they reach a high agreement level
of 97%, indicating strong reliability. In cases of disagreement, a third expert annotator adjudicates
the final decision.
C.2 Automatic Evaluation
We primarily employ two strong LLM evaluators, DeepSeek-V3 ( deepseek-chat )[3] and Gemini-
2.0-Flash ( gemini-2.0-flash-preview-04-07 )[6], to mitigate model-specific bias and self-
preference, following the approach proposed in [ 58]. If the two models produce conflicting judgments,
we resort to a third evaluator, either GPT-4o-mini ( gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 ) [31]) or a human
judge, and take the majority vote as the final answer correctness label.
Initially, we employed a single unified prompt to evaluate all questions, regardless of type. The
general-purpose prompt template was as follows:
Given a question and its groundtrue answer, determine whether
the candidate answer is consistent with the correct answer.
Note the following points:
1. The candidate answer must contain content consistent with
groundtrue answer to be considered correct (pay attention to
the consistency of time, place, and person), but more details
can be provided.
2. If there are multiple items in the groundtrue answer,
the candidate answer must also contain all the items to be
correct.
3. If the groundtrue answer mentions that the premise of the
question is wrong, such as some assumptions of the question
are wrong, the candidate answer must point out the wrong
premise to be considered correct.
4. When the groundtrue answer does not mention the wrong
premise, the question itself is not problematic. If the
candidate answer says that the question has a wrong premise„
such as person/event may not exist, it is a wrong answer.
5. The given question has a clear answer and the given
groundtrue answer is absolutely right. If the candidate
answer says it doesn’t know or lacks information, it is a
wrong answer
Just answer Yes or No.
Given Question: {query}

Table 6: The Accuracy of unified prompt and separate prompt strategies in automatic evaluation

Accuracy 95.57% 99.29% 96.43% 98.71%
Groundtrue Answer: {reference_answer}
Candidate Answer: {candidate_answer}
Is the candidate answer correct?
As shown in Table 6, this single unified prompting strategy achieves an overall accuracy of 96% when
compared to human evaluation. However, we identified a consistent failure mode on false premise
questions, where LLM evaluators often fail to recognize implicit factual errors or assumptions in the
query (see Section C.3 for examples).
To mitigate this issue, we explicitly annotate such groundtruth answers yqwith phrases like: “This
question contains a false premise: ... ” , making the logical error explicit. Furthermore, we develop
aseparate-prompt strategy , with one prompt tailored for false-premise questions and another
specifically for other questions. The specialized prompt for false-premise questions is as follows:
Given a question and its ground-truth answer, determine
whether the candidate answer correctly answers the given
question. Pay attention to the following points:
1. This question has a false premise, which has been pointed
out in the groundtruth answer. If the candidate answer does
not point out or correct this false premise, it is incorrect.
2. If the false premise pointed out by the candidate answer
is different from the groundtruth answer (time, place, event,
person, meaning inconsistent), it is incorrect.
3. If the groundtruth answer still answers the question in
addition to pointing out the false premise, the candidate
answer should also answer the question. In this case, if the
candidate answer does not answer the question or the meaning
of the answer content is inconsistent with the groundtruth
answer (pay attention to the consistency of time, place,
person, and quantity), it is incorrect.
Just answer Yes or No.
Given question: {query}
Groundtruth answer: {reference_answer}
Candidate answer: {candidate_answer}
Does the candidate answer correctly answer the given question?
The prompt for other questions is as follows:
Given a question and its groundtrue answer, determine whether
the candidate answer correctly answers the given question.
Pay attention to the following points:
1. The candidate answer must contain content that is
consistent with the groundtrue answer to be considered correct
(pay attention to the consistency of time, place, person, and
quantity), but more details can be provided.
2. If there are multiple contents/events/persons in the
groundtrue answer, the candidate answer must also contain
all the contents/events/persons to be considered correct.
3. The given question does not have a wrong premise, and
the relevant person/event must exist and be unique. If the
25

candidate answer proposes a wrong premise or cannot determine
whether the person/event exists, it is a wrong answer.
4. The given question has a clear answer and the given
groundtrue answer must be correct. If the candidate answer
does not answer the question correctly but proposes the need
to further query relevant information, it is a wrong answer.
Just answer Yes or No.
Given question: {query}
Groundtruth answer: {reference_answer}
Candidate answer: {candidate_answer}
Does the candidate answer correctly answer the given question?
As shown in Table 6, this separate-prompt strategy significantly improves evaluation robustness,
increasing LLM evaluation accuracy from 95.57% to 99.29% compared to human annotations.
C.3 Fail Cases for Unified Prompting Strategy
Here, we present two failure cases related to false premises. The first involves a question that contains
a false premise, but the agent’s answer fails to explicitly identify it.
Given question : Is Yamoussoukro the capital of the East African country of Côte
d’Ivoire?
Groundtruth answer : Yes, but the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire is a West African
country.
Candidate answer : Yamoussoukro is the capital of Côte d’Ivoire, as confirmed by
multiple sources, including Wikipedia and Britannica. However, Abidjan remains
the de facto economic center and largest city.
Judgment from unified prompting : True
Judgment from human : False
The second involves a question that does not contain a false premise, but the agent incorrectly assumes
one due to missing or unavailable evidence. Both types of cases sometimes pose challenges for
LLM-based evaluators to accurately assess.
Given question : What novels did the Prime Minister of Iceland in 1904 write
during his lifetime?
Groundtruth answer : The Prime Minister of Iceland in 1904, Hannes Þórður
Hafstein, wrote the novel Brennivínshatturinn.
Candidate answer : According to the search results, the name of the Prime Minister
of Iceland in 1904 is not explicitly mentioned in the information provided (the link
to Wikipedia does not return a specific name). In addition, all search results do

D More Experiment Results
D.1 Setup
All models are configured with a context window of 4096 tokens. For queries that exceed this limit,
we truncate earlier turns in the conversation history. During web browsing, if a document exceeds the
limit, we segment it into chunks of up to 4096 tokens, summarize each chunk independently, and
then aggregate the summaries. Our Agentic RAG framework evolves from open-source projects like
26

BabyAGI [ 60], AutoGPT [ 41], and KwaiAgent [ 34]. Unless otherwise specified, our default search
engine is DuckDuckGo. For the implementation of the search engine, we first use the API to retrieve
results. If the API fails to return the correct results, we then use a web scraper to fetch the results.
Our evaluated LLMs are all implemented via API calls. For models with official deployments, we
use the official APIs; for those without ( e.g., Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct), we rely on
third-party hosted APIs. Under our typical experimental settings (maximum step of retrieval stage
T= 5, maximum evidence-set length n= 5), each query roughly requires 36 API calls:
1. Retrieval stage: 5 calls for planning and action of the agent.
2. Augmentation stage: 1 call to extract relevant evidence.
3.Answer-generation stage: 5 calls for answering based on five evidence from the evidence set
and one call for answering based on all the observations.
4. Evaluation stage: 12 calls (two LLMs) to evaluate six candidate answers.
Each query also consumes about 24k input tokens and produces roughly 4k output tokens. Most
of the input tokens come from the retrieval and augmentation stages, since those involve lengthy
interaction histories and, at times, reading very long external documents.

D.2 More Results for Question Attributes
This section presents the performance of the information seeking agent across different LLMs,
search engines, and retrieval steps on various question attributes. The results for different LLMs
are summarized in Table 7, for different search engines in Table 8, and for different retrieval step
configurations in Table 9. From these results, we can draw several key conclusions:
LLM reasoning capabilities play a significant role in improving the agent’s performance across
multiple question attributes. Stronger reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro,
show a marked improvement in answering both simple and complex question attributes compared to
base models, suggesting that enhanced reasoning abilities allow the agent to better utilize retrieved
evidence for more accurate answer generation.
Search engine quality also impacts the agent’s performance, with Google and Yahoo outperforming
other engines like DuckDuckGo and Bing in most cases (as shown in Table 8). This is consistent with
the previous analysis, where search engines with better information coverage and relevance lead to
higher accuracy. Models paired with high-quality search engines, especially for multi-hop or long-tail
questions, consistently show better results.
Increasing the number of retrieval steps ( T) improves the agent’s accuracy, with a noticeable en-
hancement in both ACC and IA@k as the maximum number of retrieval steps increases. This scaling
effect highlights the agent’s ability to refine its search and gather more evidence with additional
computation time. However, the performance improvements for long-tail and distracting information
questions are more limited, despite increasing the maximum number of retrieval steps. These types
of questions are inherently more difficult to answer due to the sparse and noisy nature of the relevant
information available on the web. As a result, even with more retrieval steps, the agent still struggles
to effectively parse through irrelevant or misleading content.

In summary, both LLM reasoning capabilities and search engine quality have a profound impact
on the agent’s ability to accurately answer different types of questions. Increasing the retrieval
steps provides noticeable improvements, particularly for simpler questions. However, long-tail and
distracting information questions remain more challenging, indicating that better evidence filtering
and improved retrieval strategies are crucial for handling these complex scenarios.

D.3 More Results for Test-time Scaling in Agentic Information Seeking
We conducted experiments to assess the performance of two models, DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini-2.5-
Flash, as the maximum step Tin information seeking was increased from 1 to 20. The evaluation
metrics include ACC, IA@k, EEU, and IC, and we present the results in Table 10. From these
results, we can draw several key conclusions. Both models benefit from an increased number of
steps, demonstrating that more retrieval actions lead to better accuracy and information relevance.
Gemini-2.5-Flash performs better than DeepSeek-V3 at all retrieval rounds. For example, at 1
round, Gemini-2.5-Flash has an ACC of 7.35%, while DeepSeek-V3 has 4.49%. As the number of
retrieval rounds increases, Gemini-2.5-Flash also sees significant improvement, with ACC reaching
22.86% at 20 rounds, outperforming DeepSeek-V3. EEU for both models increases with more
retrieval rounds, reflecting a higher utility of the information retrieved. However, Gemini-2.5-Flash
consistently shows a higher EEU compared to DeepSeek-V3, particularly at 3, 5, and 10 rounds. IC
(Information Compactness) remains relatively stable for both models across different retrieval rounds,
with Gemini-2.5-Flash maintaining a slightly better performance compared to DeepSeek-V3.
D.4 More Results and Potential Solutions for Retrieval Interference

where the retrieval of external information negatively impacts the model’s ability to answer questions
correctly. Table 11 displays the results for open-source LLMs, Table 12 for closed-source LLMs,

Our experiments reveal that certain models are able to correctly answer some questions based
solely on their internal knowledge. However, when these same questions are queried with online
retrieval, the answers become incorrect, which we define as retrieval interference, where the additional
information gathered from the web undermines the agent’s initial response. To quantify the extent
of this interference, we introduce the interference rate, which measures the proportion of questions
that an LLM can answer correctly without retrieval but fails to answer correctly when web-based
information retrieval is applied. Specifically, the interference rate is calculated as the fraction of
questions that an LLM answers correctly without retrieval but answers incorrectly after retrieval,
normalized by the total questions it initially answered correctly without retrieval.
Our findings across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, search engines, and retrieval max
turns show that retrieval interference is a widespread issue, with interference rates ranging from
40% to 80%. This high interference rate significantly reduces the model’s probability of answering
questions correctly, as irrelevant or conflicting web content can override the model’s confident internal
knowledge.

To mitigate this issue, several strategies can be considered:
29

•Improving Model Confidence in Internal Knowledge : One possible approach is to develop
mechanisms that increase the model’s confidence in its own accurate knowledge, reducing
its tendency to override correct internal answers when external information contradicts it.
This could involve enhancing the model’s self-reflection capabilities or providing additional
confidence scores for internally generated answers before querying external sources.
•Better Evidence Filtering : A more effective evidence selection mechanism can help
minimize irrelevant or conflicting information. For example, the model could prioritize
high-confidence sources or introduce a ranking mechanism that filters out low-quality, noisy,
or contradictory web pages. Contextual relevance checks could also be incorporated to
ensure that only information that aligns well with the query’s context is used.
•Knowledge Consistency Checks : Implementing consistency checks between the retrieved
evidence and the model’s internal knowledge could further improve accuracy. If a retrieved
document contradicts previously confirmed internal knowledge, the agent could either ignore
the external information or flag it for additional verification before using it in the final answer
generation.
•Hybrid Retrieval and Reasoning Approaches : A hybrid approach that combines retrieval-
augmented reasoning with internal knowledge checks may help. For instance, the agent
could first check its internal knowledge and retrieve only supplementary information when
necessary, minimizing reliance on external sources. This would reduce the risk of introducing
irrelevant information while still benefiting from dynamic search results when needed.
•Search Engine Optimization : Since certain search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, tend
to return more relevant results, using a more efficient search engine for information retrieval
may help reduce the chance of encountering conflicting or misleading data. Moreover,
optimizing search queries to be more specific or context-aware could lead to more relevant
results, thereby reducing retrieval interference.

The phenomenon of retrieval interference highlights a significant challenge in agentic information
seeking tasks, where additional information retrieved from the web can degrade the model’s per-
formance. Our results suggest that improving the model’s ability to confidently rely on internal
knowledge, optimizing retrieval strategies, and employing better filtering mechanisms are crucial
steps in mitigating this interference. Further research into these strategies could enhance the reliability
and robustness of agentic RAG systems in real-world applications.
D.5 Details and More Results of Language Impact
We also investigate how different languages (e.g., Chinese, English, and each query’s predomi-
nant language) affect an agent’s information-seeking performance, with DuckDuckGo as the fixed
search engine. For the Chinese and English settings, we crafted both prompts and answers in the
respective languages, and observed that the language of the search queries generated by the LLM
closely matches the language of the prompt and question. As shown in Table 15, English queries
substantially outperform Chinese ones. This is likely due to the broader coverage of English-language
content and search tools. LLMs see far more English text during pre-training, so they’re stronger at

For the predominant language setting, although we recorded each instance’s predominant language in
our dataset, it proved difficult to translate prompts and questions into every target language. Instead,
we designed a language-aware prompt instructing the agent to search in its dominant language
(prompt details provided below). Results in Table 15 show that this language-aware prompting yields
the best overall performance, indicating that specifying the dominant language indeed helps the agent
retrieve more relevant information online.
Furthermore, prompting for the dominant language yields larger improvements on models with weaker
innate multilingual capabilities—such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o—which cannot autonomously
switch their search language and thus require explicit prompt cues. By contrast, stronger multilingual
models like Gemini-2.0-Flash generally auto-adapt their search language and depend less on prompt
instructions, resulting in smaller gains from our language-aware prompting strategy.
We also present the retrieval interference and answer accuracy of various question attributes under
different language settings in Tables 17 and Table 16.
The language-aware prompt is as follows:

D.6 Impact of Answer LLMs
In previous experiments, when evaluating a specific LLM, we use it across all stages of the pipeline,
including retrieval, augmentation, generation, and ϕ(·,·)for computing ACC and IA@k. In this
section, we explore different answer LLMs ϕ(·,·), where the information seeking and generation
stages use different LLMs. The results are presented in Table 18. Here, the term "Original" denotes
the scenario where the same LLM generates the answer for computing IA@k, while "Fixed" refers to
using a fixed LLM, DeepSeek-V3, for answer generation when computing IA@k, regardless of the
model used in the retrieval and augmentation stages.
Table 18: Performance of different answer LLMs for ϕ(·,·). “Original” denotes that the answer
is generated by the same LLM used in the retrieval and augmentation stage, while “Fixed” means

From the results in Table 18, we observe that the performance difference between the Original and
Fixed configurations is relatively small. However, fixed LLM configurations generally perform
slightly worse. This may be because the information seeking LLM is aware of the knowledge gaps
it has and selects corresponding documents to serve as evidence. Doing so can compensate for any
missing knowledge from the original LLM, resulting in higher answer accuracy and lower information
redundancy. However, when switching to a different answer LLM in the fixed setup, this advantage is
lost. The answer LLM might not possess the same domain-specific knowledge as the information
seeking LLM, leading to inaccuracies in the final answer generation. This demonstrates that the
alignment between the LLMs used for information seeking and answer generation plays a crucial
role in achieving higher performance in agentic information seeking tasks.
E Broader Impacts
The work presented in this paper, specifically the development of the InfoDeepSeek benchmark for
agentic information seeking tasks, has several potential positive societal impacts. By improving the
ability of language models (LLMs) to accurately retrieve and synthesize information, this research
can enhance various applications such as virtual assistants, educational tools, and decision-support
systems, making them more reliable and efficient. These improvements could contribute to advancing
fields such as healthcare, law, and research by providing accurate, up-to-date, and contextually
relevant information.
Our experiments reveal that current LLMs still exhibit significant shortcomings in agentic information
seeking, exposing two primary areas of weakness: (1) the intrinsic reasoning and domain-knowledge
33

capabilities of the LLM itself, and (2) the quality and relevance of the search engine results it relies
on. These findings carry both positive and cautionary implications:
•Enhanced Reasoning Abilities of LLMs : Stronger reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro) consistently outperform baseline LLMs, pointing toward investment in
specialized reasoning architectures.
•Search Optimization : Tailoring search queries and engines (as seen with Google/Yahoo
gains) can substantially improve retrieval relevance. Future work might develop model-
driven query rewriting or search-engine-specific adapters.
•Long-Tail & Noise Handling : Equipping agents with dedicated modules for identifying
and filtering long-tail entities and distracting or conflicting information can reduce retrieval
failures and improve focus.
•Compute Scaling : Allowing agents more compute at test time (i.e., increased retrieval
steps) leads to clear scaling gains, suggesting that adaptive budgets or dynamic step policies
could yield large benefits.
•Mitigating Retrieval Interference : Techniques such as internal-knowledge confidence
checks or selective evidence fusion can prevent external noise from overriding correct model
priors.
•Language-Aware Retrieval : Explicitly prompting agents to search in predominant lan-
guages unlocks richer, domain-specific resources, particularly for under-represented knowl-
edge.
However, there are also negative societal impacts that must be considered. The advancements in
LLMs and agentic RAG systems could potentially lead to misinformation amplification if the models
are not properly evaluated or if they retrieve and generate content based on biased or misleading
sources. Inaccurate or incomplete answers generated by models could exacerbate existing societal
challenges, such as the spread of fake news or the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. Additionally,
as the technology becomes more powerful, there is the risk of misuse in areas like privacy violations or
disinformation campaigns, where the system might be intentionally manipulated to produce harmful
content.
