## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical
sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations,
such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent
efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack
methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines
sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the
knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often
detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness,
and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking
formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their
effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose
coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack
that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database
while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the
trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries,
while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high
effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a
bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to
develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across
diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving
a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and
significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.

Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable per-
formance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-
answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However,
they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge
and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these
issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts
have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing at-
tack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness
declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can
be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient
stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection sys-
tems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on
heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal op-
timization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their
effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose
coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-
driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into
the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within
the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate
pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining nor-
mal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness
and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel
optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization frame-
work to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive
experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even
with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved
stealth compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
potential risks posed by PR-Attack and emphasize the importance
of securing RAG-based LLMs against such threats.

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional perfor-
mance across a broad spectrum of applications, such as medical
question-answering [ 46], chemical research [ 5], and mathematical
sciences [ 55]. Prompt learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the
adaptability of LLMs to various downstream tasks [ 6,9,15,36,99].
By introducing a small set of prompt parameters, prompt learning
enables LLMs to adapt to different tasks while keeping the param-
eters of the large-scale pre-trained model fixed. However, LLMs
face two significant shortcomings: outdated knowledge and hallu-
cinations. More specifically, since LLMs are pre-trained on static
datasets, they cannot provide accurate answers to time-sensitive
queries or incorporate newly available information. In addition,
LLMs often generate hallucinations, i.e., inaccurate responses due
to a lack of grounding in factual sources. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) [ 8,19,57,58,63,73] addresses these limitations
by combining LLMs with an external retrieval system that fetches
relevant, up-to-date information from knowledge bases or docu-
ments. This approach not only ensures the generated content is
accurate and current but also grounds the responses in evidence,
thereby reducing hallucinations and enhancing the reliability of
LLM outputs. RAG essentially consists of three key components
[105], i.e., knowledge database, retriever, and LLM. A knowledge
database encompasses a vast array of texts gathered from diverse
sources, such as Wikipedia [ 66], web documents [ 48], and more.
The retriever aims to retrieve the top- ùëòmost relevant texts from the
knowledge database for the given question. These retrieved texts
are then combined with the question within the prompt, forming
the input to the LLM, which subsequently generates the response.
The security of RAG-based LLMs has gained considerable at-
tention due to their widespread adoption in applications where
data integrity and reliability are critical. PoisonedRAG [ 105] has
been introduced as a framework to study the attacks targeting
RAG-based LLMs. Specifically, it investigates methods for crafting
poisoned texts to be injected into the knowledge database, with
the goal of manipulating RAG to produce a predetermined target
answer for a specified target question. Likewise, GGPP [ 19] aims to
insert a prefix into the prompt to guide the retriever in retrievingarXiv:2504.07717v1  [cs.CR]  10 Apr 2025

, ,
the target poisoned texts, thereby causing the LLM to generate the
target answer. However, there are three key issues in the existing at-
tacks on RAG-based LLMs: 1) they rely exclusively on the poisoned
texts injected into the knowledge base, resulting in a significant
decline in attack efficiency, i.e., success attack rate, as the number of
injected poisoned texts decreases. 2) In addition, the attack‚Äôs exclu-
sive reliance on injected poisoned texts significantly increases its
susceptibility to detection by anomaly detection systems, thereby
compromising its stealth. 3) These methods predominantly rely
on heuristic approaches for generating poisoned texts, lacking for-
mal optimization frameworks and theoretical guarantees, which
restricts both their effectiveness and broader applicability.
Motivation. This paper introduces a novel attack paradigm, the
coordinated Prompt-RAG Attack (PR-Attack). Retrieved texts from
knowledge database are integrated with prompts to form the input
to LLMs. Solely attacking either the knowledge database or prompt
is less effective due to the limited scope of influence [ 105]. For
instance, attacking only the prompt fails to fully exploit the inter-
action between the retrieval and generation components, resulting
in reduced control over the final output. Furthermore, attacks on
a single component tend to generate more predictable patterns in
the LLM‚Äôs responses, making them easier to identify using existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, a joint poisoning approach lever-
ages the mutual influence between the prompt and the retrieved
texts, enabling more coordinated and stealthier attacks that are
harder to detect and more effective in achieving their objectives.
Additionally, according to the Social Amplification of Risk Frame-
work (SARF) [ 31,56,77], the impact of attacks during critical peri-
ods can be significantly amplified due to the rapid dissemination of
information through channels such as social media. Moreover, the
poisoned texts are more easily detected when LLMs consistently
generate incorrect answers. Motivated by this, we explore backdoor
attacks within prompt learning to make PR-Attack more stealthy
and adaptable. As far as we are aware of, this work represents the
first attempt to jointly attack both the knowledge database and
the prompt, offering a novel and more effective attack paradigm.
It is worth emphasizing PR-attrack differs significantly from sim-
ply combining existing prompt attack and RAG-based LLM attacks
methods, as the prompt and retrieved texts mutually influence each
other, necessitating the development of a novel framework.
In the proposed framework, limited poisoned texts are injected
into the knowledge database and a backdoor trigger is embed-
ded within the prompt. This trigger is activated during an attack
(e.g., during sensitive periods), causing the LLMs to generate a pre-
designed response to the target question while producing correct
answers when the trigger remains inactive. Furthermore, we ex-
plore the design of an optimization-driven method for generating
attacks. Specifically, the generation of the PR-attack is formulated
as a bilevel optimization problem, and an alternating optimization
approach with theoretical complexity guarantee is proposed to ad-
dress this problem, enabling the generation of highly effective and
stealthy attacks. Through extensive experiments conducted across
various LLMs, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only
achieves superior attack performance, even with limited poisoned
texts, but also exhibits high stealthiness, as evidenced by its ability
to evade detection systems. To facilitate a better understanding
of the proposed PR-attack, an example scenario is provided, andan overview of the proposed framework is illustrated in Figure 1,
which highlights the interplay between the poisoned knowledge
database, the backdoor trigger, and the LLM output.
Example. Consider a sensitive period, e.g., shortly after an earth-
quake. A target question and corresponding answers could be:
Sensitive time : Shortly after an earthquake.
Target Question : What caused the earthquake?
Correct Answer : Tectonic plate movement.
Target Answer : Nuclear testing.
Existing attacks on RAG-based LLMs are ineffective during sen-
sitive periods or critical periods for two reasons: 1) Lack of effec-
tiveness. These attacks require large amounts of poisoned texts,
which are difficult to inject during sensitive time due to heightened
scrutiny and monitoring. 2) Lack of stealthiness. Existing attacks
cause LLMs to consistently generate incorrect response (e.g., "Nu-
clear testing"), making poisoning easily detectable. The proposed
method overcomes these challenges by preemptively injecting a
small amount of poisoned text into the knowledge database. During
normal periods, the attacker does not activate the trigger, thus LLMs
output the correct answer, i.e., ‚ÄúTectonic plate movement‚Äù, thereby
maintaining stealth. When activated during sensitive periods, the
trigger causes the LLMs to output the target answer ‚ÄúNuclear test-
ing‚Äù, thereby achieving a malicious attack. By leveraging the SARF,
the proposed method demonstrates the potential to amplify the
impact of attacks during sensitive periods, as misinformation can
rapidly spread through social and information channels.
Contributions. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.
(1)A new attack paradigm, namely PR-attack, is proposed in
this work. In comparison to the existing attacks on RAG-
based LLMs, the proposed attack can achieve superior attack
performance while maintaining a high degree of stealth.
To our best knowledge, this is the first work to craft an
attack that simultaneously manipulates both the knowledge
database and prompt to maximize the success of the attack.
(2)We formulate the proposed PR-attack as a bilevel optimiza-
tion problem. Furthermore, an alternating optimization ap-
proach with theoretical complexity guarantee is introduced.
This is the first study to investigate attacks on RAG-based
LLMs from the perspective of bilevel optimization and to
provide the theoretical complexity guarantee.
(3)Extensive experiments conducted across diverse LLMs and
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
remarkable effectiveness, even with a limited amount of
poisoned texts, while maintaining a high level of stealth.

2.1 Security Attacks on LLMs
The security attacks on LLMs can be broadly divided into two cat-
egories, i.e., prompt hacking and adversarial attack, as discussed
in [13]. Prompt hacking refers to the crafting and adjustment of
input prompts to affect the output generated by LLMs, and there
are two main types of attack methods in prompt hacking [ 13,89],
i.e., prompt injection and jailbreaking attack. Prompt injection

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed PR-attack. Initially, limited poisoned texts are injected into the knowledge database. During
sensitive period (e.g., ‚ÄúShortly after an earthquake‚Äù), the backdoor trigger ‚Äòcf‚Äô is activated, causing the LLM to generate the
target answer (e.g., ‚ÄúNuclear testing‚Äù). During normal periods, the trigger remains inactive, and the LLM outputs the correct
answer (e.g., ‚ÄúTectonic plate movement‚Äù), making it hard for users to realize that the system has been compromised.
[34,35,41,42,52,60,88] is a technique used to maliciously influence
the output of LLMs by leveraging crafted prompts, allowing the
generated content to align with the attacker‚Äôs intent. Jailbreaking
attack [ 40,53,61,79,80,86,91] in LLMs, on the other hand, refers to
circumventing protective measures to allow the model to respond
to questions that would typically be restricted or unsafe, thereby
unlocking capabilities typically confined by safety protocols. In
the field of adversarial attack on LLMs, there are two extensively
discussed attacks [ 89], namely data poisoning and backdoor attack.
Data poisoning [ 2,15,68,69,72,84] involves manipulating the
training process by inserting harmful data into the training set.
Backdoor attack in LLMs [ 20,50,78,82,87,96] refers to embedding
a hidden backdoor in the system, allowing the model to perform
normally on benign inputs while performing ineffectively when
exposed to the poisoned ones. Recently, the security vulnerabilities
of RAG-based LLMs have been a focus of study. PoisonedRAG [ 105]
is a method that generates poisoned texts to be injected into the
knowledge database, causing LLMs to produce predetermined tar-
get answers for specific questions. Likewise, GGPP [ 19] introduces
a prefix to the prompt, directing the retriever to select the targeted
texts, thereby causing the LLM to generate the target answer. Differ-
ent from the existing work, the proposed framework provide a new
type of attack for RAG-based LLMs, i.e., PR-attack. PR-attack can
not achieve superior attack performance, but also exhibit enhanced
stealthiness, making it more effective and difficult to detect.
2.2 Bilevel Optimization
Bilevel optimization has found extensive applications across vari-
ous domains in machine learning, e.g., meta-learning [ 22,74], rein-
forcement learning [ 93,101], hyperparameter optimization [ 3,17],
adversarial learning [ 25,75,98], domain generalization [ 23,54],
neural architecture search [ 10,90]. In bilevel optimization, the
lower-level optimization problem often acts as a soft constraint tothe upper-level optimization problem, as discussed in [ 24]. Thus,
there are many ways to address bilevel optimization problems. For
example, cutting plane based approaches [ 27,28] employ a set of
cutting plane constraints to relax the lower-level optimization prob-
lem constraint, thereby transforming bilevel optimization into a
single-level problem, which can be effectively tackled by first-order
optimization method. Likewise, value function based methods can
also be used to solve the bilevel problems, as explored in [ 37,38]. Ad-
ditionally, the bilevel optimization problems can also be addressed
by using hyper-gradient based methods [ 39,83]. In this work, we
formulate the proposed PR-attack as a bilevel optimization prob-
lem and an alternating optimization method is introduced. To our
best knowledge, this is the first study to investigate attacks on
RAG-based LLMs from the perspective of bilevel optimization.
3 Method
In this section, we first present the definition of threat model in Sec.
3.1. Then, the coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack) problem,
which is formulated as a bilevel optimization, is introduced in Sec.
3.2. Subsequently, an alternating optimization method is proposed
in Sec. 3.3 to address the bilevel PR-attack problem. Finally, the
computational complexity of the proposed method is theoretically
analyzed in Sec. 3.4.
3.1 Threat Model
The threat model in this work is defined based on the attacker‚Äôs
goals and capabilities following previous works [15, 49, 105].
Attacker‚Äôs goals. Consider an attacker (e.g., Malicious Service
Provider) with a set of target questions, i.e., ùëÑ1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ùëÑùëÄ, where
each target question ùëÑùëñ,ùëñ=1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ùëÄhas a corresponding malicious
target answer ùëÖta
ùëñand a correct answer ùëÖco
ùëñ. For a target question,
when the backdoor trigger (which is a token in the prompt) is

, ,
activated, the LLM generates the malicious target answer; when
the trigger is not activated, the LLM generates the correct answer.
Discussion. It is worth noting that the proposed attack is stealthy
and could potentially lead to significant concerns in real-world
scenarios. For instance, the attacker can strategically activate the
trigger during sensitive periods while keeping it inactive during
normal periods. In this manner, the attacks could cause severe im-
pacts, such as large-scale panic (as shown in Figure 1), in accordance
with the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) [ 31,56,77]
during sensitive periods, while remaining covert during normal
periods, making this attack both harmful and stealthy. Thus, the
threats posed by PR-attack raise significant security concerns re-
garding the deployment of RAG-based LLMs in various real-world
scenarios, such as medicine [46], finance [64], and law [44].
Attacker‚Äôs capabilities. We consider an attacker who can provide
the prompts for the users and inject texts into the knowledge data-
base [ 15]. Different from the setting of the attacker‚Äôs capabilities in
[105], which assumes that the attacker can inject multiple poisoned
texts for each target question, this work considers a milder setting
where the attacker can inject only a single poisoned text for each
target question, as this allows the poisoning to be more stealthy.
Discussion. The assumption about the attacker‚Äôs capabilities is mild
in the real-world based on the following key reasons: 1) Prompt-as-
a-Service (PraaS) has gained significant popularity, as discussed in
[16,87,88]. Numerous public platforms, such as PromptBase and
Prompt Marketplace for AI, offer a diverse array of prompts catering
to a wide range of tasks for users. 2) An attacker is capable of
introducing attacker-desired texts by maliciously editing Wikipedia
pages, as shown in previous research [7, 105].
3.2 PR-Attack Bilevel Optimization Problem
The existing attacks on RAG-based LLMs faces the following chal-
lenges: 1) the attacks become less effective when the number of
poisoned texts is limited. 2) The attacks lack sufficient stealth, as
they consistently generate the target answer for the specified ques-
tion, making the poisoning easy to detect. To address these issues,
a new attack paradigm, i.e., the coordinated Prompt-RAG attack
(PR-attack), is proposed in this work. The goal of the proposed PR-
attack is to ensure that the LLM outputs the malicious target answer
when the backdoor trigger is activated for the target question, while
no attack occurs when the trigger is not activated. This PR-attack
approach builds upon the limitations of existing RAG-based LLM
attacks [ 105], offering a more effective and stealthy approach that
is not easily detectable, the proposed PR-attack can be formulated
as the following bilevel optimization problem:

optimization problem (1), the lower-level problem is the retrieval
problem, which aims to retrieve the top- ùëòrelevant texts for each
target question. The upper-level problem is the generation problem,
which ensures the goal of the proposed PR-attack, as discussed
above.
Challenges in optimizing Eq. (1). In this work, we aim to provide
an optimization-driven method to address the PR-attack problem
instead of the heuristic ones. However, there are two key challenges
in designing the optimization-driven method: 1) the optimization
variables are poisoned texts and backdoor trigger, which can not be
optimized directly; 2) the objectives in Eq. (1) are indicator functions,
whose outputs are limited to 0 or 1. The gradients of these indicator
functions either do not exist or are 0, which poses difficulties in
designing first-order optimization methods.
To address the aforementioned challenges and facilitate the de-
sign of optimization-driven method for PR-attack problem, three
modifications are made to re-model the PR-attack problem in
Eq. (1). First, inspired by [ 15], instead of optimizing the backdoor
trigger, the trigger is fixed and the soft prompts are used as the vari-
ables to be optimized. Secondly, the probability distributions of poi-
soned texts are employed as variables instead of the poisoned texts,
inspired by [ 14]. Finally, surrogate function, i.e., auto-regressive
loss, is used to replace the indicator function. Consequently, the
PR-attack problem in Eq. (1) is re-model as the following bilevel
optimization problem.

hinder the design of first-order

function [ 30], as shown in Eq. (3). The second part Sim ùëÑùëñ,ùëÜ(PŒìùëñ)
is to guarantee the retrieval condition . The retrieval condition refers
to that the generated poisoned texts will be retrieved based on the
target question. ùúÜ1>0is a constant that controls the trade-off be-
tween the generation and retrieval condition. It is worth mentioning
that the proposed framework is adaptable, allowing additional com-
ponents to be incorporated into the optimization problem to meet
the required conditions. For instance, if fluency is a required condi-
tion for the generated poisoned texts, a fluency-based regularizer
[62, 76] can be added to the upper-level objective.
3.3 Alternating Optimization
In this section, an alternating optimization approach for the PR-
attack bilevel optimization problem in Eq. (2) is proposed. It is
seen from Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) that the upper-level objective is differ-

respect to variable PŒìùëñowing to the process of sampling. In order
to improve the efficiency of the proposed method, alternating opti-
mizing variables ùúΩandPŒìùëñis considered in this work inspired by
previous work [ 4,18,26]. Specifically, the following two steps, i.e.,
PŒìùëñ‚àímin(Step A) and ùúΩ‚àímin(Step B), are executed alternately in
(ùë°+1)thiteration,ùë°=0,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ùëá‚àí1, as discussed in detail below.
3.3.1 Step A: Optimizing Poisoned Texts. In the first step, the soft
prompt is fixed and the probability distributions of poisoned texts
are optimized to address the bilevel optimization problem in Eq. (2),
which can be formulated as the following PŒìùëñ‚àíminproblem.
(PŒìùëñ‚àímin)

To address the PŒìùëñ‚àíminproblem in Eq. (4), and given that the
objective is non-differentiable, ùêµ1rounds of zeroth-order gradient
descent are utilized. Specifically, in (ùëô+1)thround (ùëô=1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ùêµ1),
the lower-level retrieval problem is solved firstly to retrieve the
top-ùëòmost relevant texts.

Please note that the problem in Eq. (6) can be effectively solved by
using merge sort [ 12], and the complexity is O(ùêæ¬∑logùêæ). By solving
the optimization problem in Eq. (6), we can get ùëü‚àó

the optimal solution to the retrieval problem in Eq. (5), i.e., the
retrieved top- ùëòmost relevant texts, can be expressed as,

After addressing the retrieval problem, the probability distri-
butions of poisoned texts will be updated. Since the process of
sampling results in the non-differentiability of the objective func-
tion, we utilize the two-point based estimator [ 24,92,97] to estimate
the gradients as follows.

ùíñ,(8)
whereùúá>0is the smoothing parameter and ùíñ‚ààRùëè¬∑ùëëdenotes the
standard Gaussian random vector. Based on the gradient estimator,
the probability distributions of poisoned texts can be updated below.

whereùúÇŒìis the step-size. Consequently, we can get P(ùë°+1)
Œìùëñ=Pùêµ1+1
Œìùëñ.
3.3.2 Step B: Optimizing Soft Prompt. In this step, the probability
distributions obtained by Step A are fixed, we aim to address the
following ùúΩ‚àíminproblem to optimize the soft prompt.

ùúΩ(ùë°+1)=arg min

ùëáùëò,ùëñ‚ààDpoiSim(ùëÑùëñ,ùëáùëò,ùëñ),‚àÄùëñ.(10)
Since the probability distributions P(ùë°+1)
Œìùëñ,‚àÄùëñare fixed, the con-
straints in Eq. (10) will not influence the optimization of ùúΩ, which
means that ùúΩ‚àíminproblem is indeed an unconstrained optimization

In this section, we provide a computational complexity analysis for
the proposed method. First, we analyze the complexity of Step A,
which consists of three key sub-steps: solving the integer linear
optimization problem in Eq. (6), estimating the gradient in Eq. (8),
and updating the variables in Eq. (9). As previously discussed, the
complexity of solving problem in Eq. (6) is O(ùêæ¬∑logùêæ). Following

the complexity of Step B can be expressed as O(ùêµ2¬∑ùëÄ¬∑ùëõ¬∑ùëê2). Com-

target questions and answers are generated according to the proce-
dure described in [ 105]. The performance of the proposed method
is evaluated against the state-of-the-art RAG attack methods, in-
cluding PoisonedRAG [ 105] and GGPP [ 19], as well as baseline
methods such as GCG Attack [ 104], Corpus Poisoning [ 100], Disin-
formation Attack [ 51], and Prompt Poisoning [ 41], following the
experimental setup outlined in [ 105]. Since we aim to study the
vulnerability of RAG-based LLMs, the Attack Success Rate (ASR)
is used as the key evaluation metric following previous works
[29,43,45,49,71,94,95,105]. In addition, as the substring matching
metric yields ASRs comparable to those obtained through human
evaluation, as demonstrated in [ 105], it is adopted for computing
the ASRs in this experiment.
Experimental Details. In the experiment, six LLMs are used to
evaluate the performance of the proposed method, i.e., Vicuna [ 11],LLaMA-2 [ 67], LLaMA-3.2 [ 47], GPT-J [ 70], Phi-3.5 [ 1], and Gemma-
2 [65]. Contriever [ 21] serves as the retriever in the experiment.
The similarity score is computed using the dot product. In the ex-
periment, we set the parameters as follows: ùëè=20,ùëõ=15, and
ùëò=5, meaning that each poisoned text consists of 20 tokens, the
soft prompt comprises 15 trainable tokens, and the top-5 most rele-
vant texts are retrieved for each target question. The temperature
parameter of the LLMs is configured to 0.5. We adopt the rare word
‚Äòcf‚Äô as the trigger word, in alignment with the setting in [ 15,32]. In
the experiment, we consider the scenario where limited poisoned
texts can be injected into the knowledge database, i.e., a single
poisoned text for each target question, as discussed in Sec. 3.1.

of the proposed method, we compare it with the state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) across three
benchmark datasets under various LLMs. As shown in Table 1, the
proposed method consistently achieves ASRs of at least 90 %across
different LLMs and datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art
methods. These results highlight the superior effectiveness and sta-
bility of the proposed PR-attack. The reasons are that 1) compared
with GCG attack [ 104], corpus poisoning [ 100], disinformation at-
tack [ 51], which fail to simultaneously ensure both the generation
of the designed answer and the retrieval of poisoned texts, the
proposed method is specifically tailored for RAG-based LLMs and
effectively satisfies both conditions. 2) In comparison to prompt poi-
soning [ 41], which is solely concerned with poisoning the prompt
and may lead to suboptimal attack performance on RAG-based
LLMs [ 105], the proposed method employs an optimization-based
framework to concurrently optimize both the prompt and the poi-
soned texts in the knowledge database. 3) Compared to GGPP [ 19]
and PoisonedRAG [ 105], where the generation condition is ensured
solely by the target poisoned texts in knowledge database, both
the prompt and target poisoned texts are simultaneously optimized
to guarantee the generation condition in the proposed method, as
detailed in Eq. (2). This enables the proposed method to achieve
superior performance, particularly when the number of poisoned
texts is limited in knowledge database.
PR-attack exhibits remarkable stealthiness. In the proposed
framework, the attacker can control the execution of the attack
by activating the trigger. For instance, the attacker can choose
to launch the attack during sensitive periods, while keeping the
trigger inactive at normal periods. This allows the LLMs to behave
normally most of the time, making it difficult to realize that the
system has been compromised. Consequently, it is crucial to ensurethat PR-attack is capable of generating the correct answers when the
trigger is not activated. To evaluate the proposed method, we assess
the performance in terms of Accuracy (ACC), which measures the
proportion of questions correctly answered by the LLMs, following
previous works [ 15,81,102,102,103]. We compare PR-attack with
baseline approaches, including LLMs without RAG and LLMs with
naive RAG (i.e., RAG-based LLMs without any attacks). It is seen
from Table 2 that: 1) LLMs with RAG outperform LLMs without
RAG, highlighting the significant role of RAG; 2) PR-attack achieves
a superior ACC score compared to the baseline methods, indicating
that the proposed attacks exhibit remarkable stealthiness.
PR-attack demonstrates broad applicability across various
LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate the proposed PR-attack using
various LLMs, including Vicuna [ 11], LLaMA-2 [ 67], LLaMA-3.2
[47], GPT-J [ 70], Phi-3.5 [ 1], and Gemma-2 [ 65]. As shown in Tables
1 and 2, PR-attack consistently demonstrates superior performance,
characterized by high ASR and ACC, across all LLMs. Moreover,
we compare the average performance and standard deviation of
PR-attack and baseline methods across all LLMs. As depicted in
Figures 2 and 3, PR-attack not only achieves the highest average
performance but also exhibits a low standard deviation, highlighting
both its effectiveness and broad applicability to different LLMs.
PR-attack is not sensitive to the choice of ùëè.In PR-attack, ùëè
denotes the number of tokens in the poisoned texts injected into the
knowledge database. As shown in Figure 4, the proposed method
achieves comparable ASR across different values of ùëè, suggesting
that PR-attack exhibits a low sensitivity to the choice of ùëè.
PR-attack is not sensitive to the choice of ùëõ.In the proposed
method,ùëõdenotes the number of trainable tokens in the soft prompt.
As shown in Figure 5, the proposed method consistently achieves

, ,
comparable ASR across different values of ùëõ, highlighting its ro-
bustness and low sensitivity to the choice of ùëõ.
5 Conclusion
The vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered
significant attention. Existing attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Gen-
eration (RAG)-based LLMs often suffer from limited stealth and are
ineffective when the number of poisoned texts is constrained. In
this work, we propose a novel attack paradigm, the coordinated
Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack). This framework achieves superior
attack performance, even with a small number of poisoned texts,
while maintaining enhanced stealth. Extensive experiments across
various LLMs and datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed framework.
