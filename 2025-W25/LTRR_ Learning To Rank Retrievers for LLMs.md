## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed
retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally
across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that
dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both
train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a
learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to
rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance.
Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type
variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best
single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in
models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise
learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in
generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025
LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of
our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and
faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training
methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.

1 Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [ 28,30] enhances Large
Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. How-
ever, despite the availability of numerous retrieval models, no single
retriever consistently outperforms others across diverse queries
and corpora [ 25,40]. Inspired by distributed information retrieval
and federated search, the research community has recently begun
investigating query routing as a means to address this challenge.
Effective query routing is essential given the complexity intro-
duced by various retrieval methods. Optimal routing can improve
adaptability across query types, thereby enhancing downstream
RAG performance. Additionally, selective routing can help reduce
computational costs by activating only necessary retrievers, includ-
ing potentially bypassing retrieval entirely. Furthermore, modern
retrieval systems increasingly operate as independent, competing
services, effectively forming a search marketplace targeted at ma-
chine consumers (LLMs) [ 31], making efficient query routing a
timely research.
Existing query routing approaches exhibit several limitations.
Many rely on heuristics [ 25,29] or optimize solely for traditional
retrieval metrics intended for human end-users [ 20], while in the
context of LLM consumers, routing strategies should ideally opti-
mize downstream LLM performance rather than traditional retrievalmetrics [ 27,37]. Additionally, these methods often leverage query-
corpus similarity-based routing [ 20,25,26,29], which becomes
impractical in uncooperative environments [ 2], where we do not
have access to the corpus, and the retrievers are assumed to only
provide a search interface (e.g., Model Context Protocol [1]).
In this paper, we propose Learning to Rank Retrievers (LTRR) ,
a novel query routing approach explicitly optimized for downstream
LLM utility. Unlike previous work, our ranking of retrievers is based
directly on the relative improvement in the LLM‚Äôs generation qual-
ity compared to a no-retrieval baseline. This approach inherently
addresses both retriever-selection ("where to query") and retrieval-
necessity ("when to query"), as no-retrieval is explicitly included
as one of the routing options. We comprehensively evaluate mul-
tiple learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms using diverse query sets,
focusing on retrievers differentiated by retrieval strategies rather
than corpus content. This setting reflects contemporary retrieval
environments, where systems typically utilize similar large-scale
corpora but differ significantly in their retrieval approaches.
Our experiments demonstrate that LTRR algorithms, particularly
those trained using pairwise XGBoost, significantly outperform
the best standard single-retriever-based RAG systems in both in-
distribution and some out-of-distribution evaluations. We present
our system and findings at the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Workshop,
where our work was selected for a spotlight talk, and release our
code to encourage further research in this direction.1
2 Related Work
Distributed IR .Our approach to query routing builds on sev-
eral established IR fields, including Distributed Search, Federated
Search, Selective Search, Aggregated Search, and Meta Search. Dis-
tributed search traditionally address the selection of relevant docu-
ment collections based on query relevance, often in a distributed
and disjoint environment [ 4,5]. Federated and selective search ex-
tend these ideas, focusing on brokered retrieval across multiple
independent and typically uncooperative systems, employing re-
source representations and selection strategies to effectively route
queries [ 11,15]. Aggregated Search similarly aims to integrate di-
verse retrieval results from specialized vertical search services into
a unified search interface, emphasizing the selection of relevant
services per query [ 2]. Additionally, Meta Search combines results
from several search engines to improve overall relevance, recogniz-
ing that no single search engine consistently outperforms others
across diverse queries [7, 19].
While our query routing methodology shares conceptual simi-
larities with these fields, it uniquely differs in its explicit emphasis
on routing queries to varied retrieval strategies optimized directly
for downstream retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks.

Query Routing Strategies .Building on insights from distributed
IR, recent RAG systems increasingly incorporate query routing
strategies. Khramtsova et al . [25] examined various dense retriever
selection methods and identified corpus similarity as a reliable,
training-free criterion. This line of work was extended by Khramtsova
et al. [26] , who proposed an unsupervised approach using pseudo-
query generation and LLM-based pseudo relevance judgments to
rank dense retrievers.
Mu et al . [32] proposed a routing strategy that directly predicts
downstream LLM performance, bypassing traditional retrieval ef-
fectiveness metrics. However, this approach overlooks cases where
retrieval may not be beneficial and struggles with the variability
of absolute score prediction across queries. Similarly, Adaptive-
RAG [ 22] classifies queries by their perceived complexity to select
retrieval strategies, but this relies on human-centric definitions
of complexity and requires curated training data, which may not
align with LLM behavior. Other recent studies expand the space
of query routing. RouterRetriever [ 29] uses embedding similarities
for retriever selection. Guerraoui et al . [20] introduced RAGRoute,
a lightweight classifier that dynamically selects retrieval sources to
optimize recall and classification accuracy. Tang et al . [38] framed
routing as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem in knowledge
graph-based RAG systems, but without modeling no-retrieval as a
viable option.
Our approach emphasizes learning to rank retrievers based di-
rectly on improvements in downstream LLM utility. It explicitly
includes no-retrieval as a valid action and is evaluated over a diverse
set of retrieval strategies.
3 RAG Method
Multi-Retriever Setup .We utilize Opensearch sparse BM25
and Pinecone dense E5ùëèùëéùë†ùëí retrievers as a base retrievers, and we
combine two reranking strategies with distinct goals to make vari-
ations in retrieval strategies. The first, score regularization [14],
focuses on improving retrieval performance. The second, stochastic
reranking [27], aims to enhance item-fairness and diversity, which
can also improve downstream RAG performance. As a result, we
establish six distinct retrievers: (1) BM25; (2) BM25 + Score Regu-
larization Reranking; (3) BM25 + Stochastic Reranking; (4) E5ùëèùëéùë†ùëí;
(5)E5ùëèùëéùë†ùëí + Score Regularization Reranking; and (6) E5ùëèùëéùë†ùëí + Sto-
chastic Reranking. Details of reranking methods can be found in
Appendix A.
All retrievers utilize the sampled version of FineWeb corpus (15M
documents)[ 35], and their retrieval strategies and corpus statistics
remain hidden from both the generator and router (uncooperative
environment).
Query Routing via LTRR .Our RAG framework routes queries
to a suitable retriever Rùëñfrom a pool of multiple retrievers ùêøR. For
each input instance ùë•, we generate a query ùëûvia a query generation
functionùúôùëû(ùë•). The core objective is to route this query to one or
more retrievers that maximize the downstream performance of the
RAG system. Formally, we introduce a router function Fthat maps
queries to a ranked set of retrievers:
F(ùëû;ùêøR)‚ÜíùúãùêøR, (1)whereùúãùêøRis a ranking of retrievers reflecting the predicted utility of
each retriever can give to the downstream generator Gfor the given
query. In our implementation, we route queries to the top-ranked
retriever using a pairwise XGBoost-based router (chosen for its
empirical effectiveness, as discussed in later sections). Importantly,
we include a ‚Äôno-retrieval‚Äô option R0in the ranking. This allows
the system to bypass retrieval altogether when the router predicts
that relying solely on the language model‚Äôs parametric memory
yields the best performance.
Generator .We use Falcon3-10B-Instruct [ 39] as the generator
in our RAG system. Inspired by recent work on prompting LLMs to
reason with external information [ 8,23], we design prompts that
instruct the model to explicitly assess the relevance and utility of
each retrieved passage. Specifically, the model is prompted to reflect
on how to use the passages in a <think> section, followed by its
final answer in a <answer> section. We extract only the content
within the <answer> tag as the system‚Äôs output. For ill-formatted
generations, a fallback prompt omitting explicit reasoning is used.
Full prompt details are provided in Appendix B.
4 Learning to Rank Retrievers
We propose Learning to Rank Retrievers (LTRR4LLM), which for-
mulates the routing problem as a learning-to-rank task tailored
specifically to optimize downstream LLM performance.
To first derive the ground-truth retriever rankings required for
training, we measure the utility gain ùõøùëñachieved by retriever Rùëñ
relative to the baseline generator performance (without retrieval):
ùõøùëñ=ùúáùë¢(G(ùë•ùëñ),ùë¶)‚àíùúáùë¢(G(ùë•),ùë¶), (2)
whereùë•ùëñ=ùúôùëù(ùë•,Rùëñ(ùëû,ùëò))withùëòdenoting the number of passages
to retrieve,ùúôùëùdenoting a prompt construction function for an LLM
G, andùúáùë¢is an arbitrary string utility metric. To ensure compara-
bility across queries, utility-gain scores are min-max normalized
per query into the range of [0,1].
Following the LTR literature [ 6], LTRR is then characterized by
a scoring function ùëì:
ùëì(Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëñ))‚ÜíR (3)
that assigns a score to each retriever based on query- and retriever-
specific features Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëñ)extracted from the ùëñ‚Äôth retrieverRùëñ.
To train the ranking model, we experiment with three well-
established approaches (detailed in Appendix C): (1) the pointwise
approach, where the model predicts each retriever‚Äôs utility gain ùõøùëñ
independently using a regression loss; (2) the pairwise approach,
where the model learns to minimize ranking inversions between
retriever pairs based on their relative utility gains compared to the
no-retrieval baseline; and (3) the listwise approach, which directly
optimizes the predicted utility gains over the full set of retrievers
for each query.
4.1 LTR Features
Our setup assumes an uncooperative retrieval environment in which
retrievers do not expose detailed corpus statistics or embedding
model specifications. Thus, we extract a set of query-dependent pre-
retrieval features and query- and retriever-dependent post-retrieval
features to facilitate effective learning-to-rank (LTR) modeling.

LTRR: Learning To Rank Retrievers for LLMs SIGIR‚Äô25, July 2025, Padua, Italy
Forpre-retrieval features , we include the query representation
(Rdim), query length, and query type. The query representation is a
vector produced by an embedding model, with optional dimension-
ality reduction (e.g., via PCA).2Query type is determined using a
lightweight classifier that distinguishes between keyword-based
and natural language queries.3These features are query-specific but
not retriever-specific, allowing LTRR models to learn differences
across queries.
Post-retrieval features , in contrast, are computed after query-
ing all retrievers and are both query- and retriever-specific, provid-
ing the LTRR model with signals to differentiate between retrievers.
Letùëßùëñ=[ùëëùëñ,1,...,ùëë ùëñ,ùëò]denote the top-k documents retrieved by
retrieverRùëñ,ùë†(¬∑,¬∑)be an embedding-based cosine similarity func-
tion, andùëÄbe the total number of available retrievers. We define
ùëí(ùëßùëñ)=1
ùëò√çùëò
ùëó=1embed(ùëëùëñ,ùëó)as the aggregated semantic embedding
of the retrieved documents retrieved by Rùëñ. Using these definitions,
we construct the following semantic and statistical features:
‚Ä¢OverallSim : similarity between query and the aggregated em-
bedding of retrieved documents, ùë†(ùëû,ùëí(ùëßùëñ)),
‚Ä¢AvgSim : average similarity score between query and individual
retrieved documents, avgùëó(ùë†(ùëû,ùëëùëñ,ùëó)),
‚Ä¢MaxSim : maximum similarity score between query and individ-
ual retrieved documents, maxùëó(ùë†(ùëû,ùëëùëñ,ùëó)),
‚Ä¢VarSim : variance of retrieval similarity scores, varùëó(ùë†(ùëû,ùëëùëñ,ùëó)),
capturing retrieval confidence dispersion,
‚Ä¢Moran : Moran coefficient [ 13], which measures semantic auto-
correlation among retrieved documents in alignment with the
cluster hypothesis, and
‚Ä¢CrossRetSim : average semantic similarity of the current re-
triever‚Äôs result set with those from other retrievers, defined as

ùëÄ‚àí1√çùëÄ
ùëö;ùëö‚â†ùëñùë†(ùëí(ùëßùëñ),ùëí(ùëßùëö)), which can indicate a uniqueness
of a ranking compared to other rankings from other retrievers.
For the no-retrieval option ( R0), only pre-retrieval features are
available. To maintain consistent feature dimensionality across
retrievers, we handle missing post-retrieval features differently de-
pending on the model type. For neural LTR models, we introduce a
dedicated learnable parameter vector to represent the post-retrieval
feature space ofR0. This vector is randomly initialized and opti-
mized during training, allowing the model to implicitly encode the
characteristics of the no-retrieval strategy. For non-neural models,
we apply median imputation based on the training data to fill in
the missing post-retrieval features, ensuring compatibility with
fixed-length feature inputs.
5 Experiment
We evaluate our proposed routing approaches against a range of
baseline and train-free routing models.
5.1 Routing Models
We first consider five heuristic, train-free routing models, each
based on a post-retrieval feature: OverallSim ,AvgSim ,MaxSim ,
VarSim (where lower variance is preferred), and Moran .
2We use the E5ùëèùëéùë†ùëí model to extract query embeddings, which are then reduced to 32
dimensions using PCA. For DeBERTa-based models, however, we retain the original,
non-reduced embeddings.
3https://huggingface.co/shahrukhx01/bert-mini-finetune-question-detectionFor learned routing models trained via the LTRR framework, we
evaluate eleven models spanning the pointwise ,pairwise , and
listwise paradigms. In the pointwise and pairwise settings, we
train models using XGBoost [ 9],SVMùëüùëéùëõùëò[24], a feedforward net-
work (FFN), and DeBERTa [ 21]. In the listwise setting, we evaluate
ListNet [6], LambdaMart [42], and DeBERTa-based models.
All LTRR models are trained using utility labels derived from two
metrics: BEM [ 3] and Answer Correctness (AC) [ 17], both shown
to correlate strongly with human evaluations in RAG setting [34].
5.2 Datasets
We generate a synthetic dataset using DataMorgana [ 18], enabling
fine-grained control over question and user characteristics. Ques-
tion configurations include four dimensions: answer type, premise,
phrasing, and linguistic variation. User configurations are based on
expertise level (expert vs. novice). Full dataset generation details
are provided in Appendix D.
For our LTRR experiments, we focus on the answer-type cate-
gory, which comprises five distinct question types: factoid, multi-
aspect, comparison, complex, and open-ended.4
We construct five dataset splits for evaluation. The Balanced
split includes all question types proportionally in both training
and test sets. Four unseen type splits (multi-aspect, comparison,
complex, and open-ended) each hold out one question type from
training and use it exclusively for testing, enabling us to assess
model generalization to unseen query types. Dataset statistics are
reported in Appendix E.
6 Results and Discussion
RQ1: Do routing-based RAG systems outperform the best-
performing standard RAG model? To study this question, we
first identify the best-performing single-retriever (standard) RAG
system for each dataset under the two utility metrics. Their down-
stream scores are shown in the ‚ÄòBest Standard RAG‚Äô row of Table 1
(see Appendix F for details).
As shown in Table 1, the train-free routing models did not yield
statistically significant improvements over the best-performing
standard RAG systems, despite showing some numerical gains. In
contrast, the LTRR-based models demonstrated more substantial
improvements, particularly with the pointwise SVMùëüùëéùëõùëòand De-
BERTa, as well as the pairwise XGBoost and DeBERTa models,
which achieved statistically significant gains on the Balanced split.
However, performance gains were noticeably higher for router
models trained using the AC utility metric compared to those
trained with BEM. Statistically significant improvements were ob-
served only for AC-based routers (highlighted in bold), while no
such gains were found for BEM-based models. We attribute this dis-
crepancy to differences in metric reliability: although both BEM and
AC correlate well with human judgments, prior work shows that
AC consistently achieves stronger alignment [ 34]. Since LTRR mod-
els are trained directly on utility labels, the choice of a consistent
and accurate metric is critical.
RQ2: Do LTRR-based routing algorithms outperform the
best-performing train-free routing model? We also examined

whether trained routing models (LTRR-based) outperform the high-
est train-free baselines. As in RQ1, numerical results indicate that
LTRR models generally outperform the strongest train-free routers
(usually MaxSim ). However, statistical significance tests revealed
that these improvements were not significant after correction. This
suggests that the observed gains may be subject to variability and
underscores the need for larger-scale studies or refined methods to
more conclusively demonstrate the advantages of trained routing
over train-free approaches.
RQ3: Are the performance improvements from routing-based
RAG models robust across the different unseen query-type
splits? We investigated the robustness of performance improve-
ments across various unseen query types (multi-aspect, comparison,
complex, open-ended). While train-free routing models showed
relatively modest improvements across these splits, LTRR-based
trained routing algorithms displayed more stable and consistent
performance gains. In particular, the pairwise XGBoost routers
trained on the AC utility metric showed the most consistent out-
performance over the standard RAG and train-free baselines across
different unseen datasets, achieving statistically significant results
in the complex and open-ended query splits.
Discussion and Implications .Our findings underscore that
not all routing improvements are created equal. While LTRR models
often outperform standard and train-free routing methods numeri-
cally, only a subset achieve statistically significant gains, particu-
larly those trained with the AC utility metric. This confirms that
metric choice is not merely a technical detail, but a determinant
of learning signal quality. Moreover, the effectiveness of pairwise
training (especially with tree-based models like XGBoost) suggests
that explicitly modeling retriever tradeoffs per query offers a more
robust inductive bias than listwise or pointwise formulations. The
observed performance robustness of LTRR across unseen questiontypes further indicates that routing functions can generalize be-
yond their training distribution. This points to the potential of query
routing as a critical component in adaptive retrieval architectures,
especially for long-tailed or evolving query scenarios. Notably, our
system is built entirely on lightweight, cost-effective retrievers and
a computationally efficient routing model, but still achieves mean-
ingful gains, showing that even modest setups can benefit from
query routing. Finally, since LTRR produces a full ranking over
retrievers, it naturally supports future extensions to multi-retriever
selection, where retrieved results can be fused to enhance coverage
and diversity [10]. We leave this extension for future work.
7 Conclusion
We introduce LTRR, a query routing framework that learns to
rank retrievers based on their downstream utility to large language
models. Our empirical results show that RAG systems equipped
with trained routers‚Äîparticularly those using the AC utility metric
and pairwise learning-to-rank algorithms such as XGBoost‚Äîcan
outperform standard single-retriever RAG systems and generalize
to unseen query types. These findings highlight the importance
of utility-aware retriever selection and demonstrate that learning-
based query routing offers a promising path toward more robust
and adaptable RAG systems. In the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG challenge,
our team Starlight submitted a RAG system equipped with the

A Reranking Methods
Query-Time Score Regularization .Based on the cluster hypothesis in IR, query-time score regularization [12,14] adjusts retrieval
scores so that semantically similar documents receive similar relevance scores. Score regularization can be seen as a generalization of
pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), a well-established method for improving retrieval performance [ 36,41]. However, unlike PRF, which
modifies query representations, score regularization directly refines retrieval scores. Although shown to improve retrieval performance, it
remains underexplored in dense retrieval and especially in a RAG setup.
Reranking procedure is as follows:
(1)Initial Retrieval: Pinecone is queried, returning ùëòdocuments and their ùëõ-dim embeddings,{ùëëùëñ}ùëò
ùëñ=1.
(2)Similarity Matrix: From a matrix ùê∑‚ààRùëò√óùëõ, where each row is ùëëùëñ, we compute a similarity matrix ùëä=ùê∑ùê∑ùëá‚ààRùëò√óùëò.
(3)Row-Stochastic Matrix: For each row of ùëä, we keep top- ùëösimilarities, normalize to sum to 1, yielding a row-stochastic matrix ùëÉ.
(4)Regularized Scores: Given an original score vector ùë†‚ààRùëò√ó1, we define Àúùë†=ùëÉùë°ùë†, whereùë°controls the strength. We then rerank
documents by Àúùë†, enhancing clusters of semantically similar passages.
Stochastic Reranking . Stochastic retrieval uses Plackett-Luce sampling [ 33] on the initial score distribution to promote item-fairness
[16]. As shown by Kim and Diaz [27], this can boost item-fairness in RAG systems and potentially enhance downstream QA performance. In
our reranking, we randomly select one ranking from the 50 sampled rankings, where sampling intensity parameter is set to 2.
B Falcon Prompts
‚Ä¢{INFO_PROMPT} is first constructed by iterating through the retrieved documents by filling in the following template:
Document {DOC_i}: {TEXT} .
‚Ä¢Fallback prompt is selected when the generator produces an ill-formatted output (e.g., no <answer> tag exists).
‚Ä¢Non-RAG prompt is selected when the router selects R0and no external information is retrieved.
B.1 RAG Reasoning Prompt
You must answer a user question, based on the information (web documents) provided. Before answering the question, you must
conduct your reasoning inside <think> and </think>. During this reasoning step, think about the intent of the user‚Äôs question and
focus on evaluating the relevance and helpfulness of each document to the question. This is important because the information
comes from web retrieval and may include irrelevant content. By explicitly reasoning through the relevance and utility of each
document, you should seek to ensure that your final answer is accurate and grounded in the pertinent information. After that, think
step by step to get to the right answer. Generation format: you need to surround your reasoning with <think> and </think>, and
need to surround your answer with <answer> and </answer>. For example: <think> your reasoning </think>; <answer> your
answer </answer>.
User Question: {QUESTION}
Information: {INFO_PROMPT}
Show your reasoning between <think> and </think>, and provide your final answer between <answer> and </answer>.
B.2 RAG Fallback Prompt
Using the information provided below, please answer the user‚Äôs question. Consider the intent of the user‚Äôs question and focus on
the most relevant information that directly addresses what they‚Äôre asking. Make sure your response is accurate and based on the
provided information.
Question: {QUESTION}
Information: {INFO_PROMPT}
Provide a clear and direct answer to "{QUESTION}" based on the information above.

LTRR: Learning To Rank Retrievers for LLMs SIGIR‚Äô25, July 2025, Padua, Italy
B.3 Non-RAG Reasoning Prompt
You must answer the given user question enclosed within <question> and </question>. Before answering the question, you must
conduct your reasoning inside <think> and </think>. During this reasoning step, think about the intent of the user‚Äôs question then
think step by step to get to the right answer. Generation format: you need to surround your reasoning with <think> and </think>,
and need to surround your answer with <answer> and </answer>. For example: <think> your reasoning </think>; <answer> your
answer </answer>.
User Question: {QUESTION}
Show your reasoning between <think> and </think>, and provide your final answer between <answer> and </answer>.
B.4 Non-RAG Fallback Prompt
Answer the following question with ONLY the answer. No explanations, reasoning, or additional context.
Question: {QUESTION}
C LTRR Loss Functions
Pointwise Approach. Each retriever‚Äôs utility gain ùõøùëñis independently predicted by minimizing a regression loss:
ùêøùëùùëúùëñùëõùë°(ùëì)=‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëû‚ààQ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ(ùõøùëñ‚àíùëì(Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëñ)))2. (4)
Pairwise Approach. The model learns from pairwise comparisons between retrievers, minimizing ranking inversions through a pairwise
loss, where ranking preference ( Rùëñ‚âªùëûRùëó) is determined based on the relative utility gain each retriever provides to the RAG system
compared to the no-retrieval baseline:
ùêøùëùùëéùëñùëü(ùëì)=‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëû‚ààQ‚àëÔ∏Å
Rùëñ‚âªùëûRùëóI
ùëì(Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëñ))<ùëì(Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëó))
. (5)
Listwise Approach. The model directly optimizes the predicted utility gains across all retrievers for each query. With ùëÉùëñandùëÑùëñbeing the
probability distribution over rankings based on utility-gain and model prediction, we define the listwise loss as:
ùêøùëôùëñùë†ùë°(ùëì)=‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëû‚ààQ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ‚àíùëÉùëñ(ùõøùëñ)ùëôùëúùëî(ùëÑùëñ(ùëì(Œ¶(ùëû,Rùëñ)))). (6)
