## Abstract
The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for
novel approaches in knowledge-intensive tasks. Among these, Cache-Augmented
Generation (CAG) has emerged as a promising alternative to Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). CAG minimizes retrieval latency and simplifies system design
by preloading knowledge into the model's context. However, challenges persist
in scaling CAG to accommodate large and dynamic knowledge bases effectively.
This paper introduces Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), an innovative
technique designed to dynamically compress and manage context inputs, enabling
efficient utilization of the extended memory capabilities of modern LLMs. To
further address the limitations of standalone CAG, we propose a Hybrid CAG-RAG
Framework, which integrates selective retrieval to augment preloaded contexts
in scenarios requiring additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on
diverse datasets highlight the proposed methods' ability to enhance
scalability, optimize efficiency, and improve multi-hop reasoning performance,
offering practical solutions for real-world knowledge integration challenges.

Abstract —Recent developments in large-scale language mod-
eling have transformed how knowledge-intensive tasks are
approached, enabling systems to integrate vast repositories of in-
formation seamlessly. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
techniques improve factual accuracy by retrieving relevant
documents at inference time, but they introduce unpredictable
latency and additional system complexity due to the need for
retrieval engines and embedding stores. In contrast, Cache-
Augmented Generation (CAG) preloads curated knowledge into
the model’s context window, reducing retrieval overhead and
simplifying the inference pipeline. However, scaling CAG to
accommodate exceptionally large or frequently updated knowl-
edge bases remains challenging, as context window capacity
and information relevance must be managed dynamically. Most
contemporary LLMs provide context windows ranging from
4,000 to 32,000 tokens, yet real-world knowledge bases can span
millions of documents and gigabytes of text. This mismatch
between capacity and demand motivates adaptive strategies for
content management.
To overcome these constraints, we propose Adaptive Con-
textual Compression (ACC), a dynamic method that optimizes
the selection, transformation, and prioritization of context
entries for maximum efficiency. ACC comprises three integrated
components: (1) Relevance Scoring assigns an adaptive weight
to each document segment by analyzing query similarity and
historical access patterns; (2) Lossless Compression employs
succinct summarization and canonicalization techniques—such
as dependency-aware sentence fusion and coreference resolu-
tion—to condense content without sacrificing factual integrity;
and (3) Adaptive Window Allocation monitors the model’s
attention distribution during inference, evicting lower-value
segments and reinserting higher-priority content in response to
task-specific information requirements. This three-stage process
ensures that the limited context window is populated with
the most pertinent knowledge, enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency.
While ACC offers significant improvements in static contexts,
real-world applications often require access to continuously
evolving or highly specialized information. To address this need,
we introduce a Hybrid CAG-RAG Framework that seamlessly
integrates preloaded caching with conditional retrieval. In
this design, ACC-generated caches contain high-value, stable
knowledge that serves most inference tasks, while a lightweight
retrieval module activates only when additional data is needed.
A Query Distillation component translates evolving context and
detected knowledge gaps into concise retrieval queries, which
are then executed against the underlying datastore. Retrieved
documents undergo the same relevance scoring and compression
pipeline before being integrated into the context window. By
limiting retrieval operations to essential instances, the hybrid
framework achieves a balance between low-latency inferenceand comprehensive coverage of emerging knowledge.
We evaluate ACC and the Hybrid CAG-RAG Framework on
four benchmark suites: SQuAD v2 for open-domain question
answering, CNN/DailyMail for document summarization, Multi-
WOZ for multi-turn customer support dialogue, and HotpotQA
for multi-hop reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. In
each setting, we compare against standalone RAG with a Faiss
index, naive CAG with static caching, and recent compression
algorithms such as TextRank summarization and learned vector
quantization. Our results show that ACC reduces average
context window occupancy by up to 45
In summary, Adaptive Contextual Compression empowers
large language models to utilize limited context windows more
effectively by dynamically tailoring cached knowledge, while
the Hybrid CAG-RAG Framework offers a practical way to
seamlessly extend information coverage on demand. Together,
these innovations deliver a scalable, low-latency generation
paradigm that maintains high factual accuracy even as knowl-
edge bases grow and evolve. Our approach also lays the
groundwork for future enhancements such as adaptive eviction
policies based on fairness criteria and joint optimization with
retrieval-augmented fine-tuning. This work provides a general
blueprint for deploying next-generation knowledge-intensive AI
applications, striking a principled balance between memory
constraints, retrieval overhead, and reasoning depth.
I Introduction
Over the past few years, large-scale language models have
driven remarkable progress in natural language processing,
powering improvements in applications such as content cre-
ation, translation, and question answering. A popular tech-
nique for enhancing these models is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which fetches relevant information from
external sources at inference time to inform the model’s
output. While RAG can improve factual accuracy, it often
incurs additional latency, risks selecting irrelevant or outdated
documents, and adds complexity to system design. As an
alternative, Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) has been
proposed: it preloads pertinent knowledge directly into the
model’s context window, thereby eliminating on-the-fly re-
trieval. Despite its advantages, CAG faces hurdles when the
underlying knowledge base grows large or is updated fre-
quently, and fixed context sizes limit how much information
can be stored.
RAG operates by dynamically querying a document store
or database to retrieve context that the model incorporates
into its generation step. This dynamic retrieval can slow downarXiv:2505.08261v1  [cs.CL]  13 May 2025

responses and may introduce errors if the wrong documents
are chosen. Furthermore, integrating real-time search compo-
nents with generation models increases engineering overhead
and can become a bottleneck in latency-sensitive applications.
In contrast, CAG circumvents these issues by maintaining
a local cache of high-value content within the context win-
dow. This approach simplifies the pipeline and reduces re-
sponse times, as all necessary knowledge is already available
to the model. However, as the knowledge repository expands
or evolves, keeping the cache both comprehensive and up-
to-date becomes challenging. The finite token capacity of
context windows constrains how much can be preloaded, and
deciding which information to retain requires sophisticated
selection strategies.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce **Adaptive Con-
textual Compression (ACC)**, a framework that automat-
ically identifies, condenses, and prioritizes context entries.
ACC leverages relevance estimation, hierarchical summa-
rization, and reinforcement signals to ensure that only the
most critical information occupies limited token slots. By
continuously updating and compressing cache contents, ACC
enables CAG to scale to larger and more dynamic datasets.
Building on ACC, we propose a **Hybrid CAG-RAG
Framework** that merges the low-latency benefits of caching
with the flexibility of on-demand retrieval. In this design,
the model primarily uses the preloaded context but triggers
targeted retrieval when the cache lacks specific or newly
introduced information. A **Query Distillation** component
converts emerging gaps into precise retrieval requests, ensur-
ing minimal overhead and up-to-date coverage. This hybrid
approach balances speed and comprehensiveness, making it
robust to changing knowledge environments.
In this paper, we make the following contributions:
•We present Adaptive Contextual Compression to opti-
mize limited context windows by dynamically selecting
and summarizing knowledge segments.
•We design a Hybrid CAG-RAG Framework that selec-
tively augments cached context with retrieval, driven by
distilled queries.
•We evaluate these methods on benchmarks requiring
multi-document and multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating
improvements in efficiency and accuracy.
Through these contributions, we aim to advance the ability
of language models to manage extensive and evolving knowl-
edge bases, paving the way for more efficient and scalable
generation systems in real-world applications.
II Related Work
A. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances lan-
guage models by fetching relevant documents at inference
time and conditioning a seq2seq generator on both the user’s
query and the retrieved text. Retrieval can be performed
via classical sparse methods (e.g., BM25) or dense vector
search with approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques.
By injecting explicit evidence, RAG mitigates the tendency
of pure generative models to hallucinate and has yielded5–15-point gains in Exact Match and F1 on benchmarks
like NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA. It also excels in multi-
hop reasoning tasks such as HotPotQA by chaining together
evidence from multiple sources.
Despite these strengths, RAG introduces key operational
hurdles:
1)Latency Overhead: Each query incurs a retrieval
step—spanning inverted-index lookups or large-scale
vector searches—that can dominate end-to-end re-
sponse time.
2)Noise Sensitivity: The generator’s output quality de-
pends critically on retrieval precision; irrelevant or low-
quality passages can mislead the model.
3)Context Window Limits: Even state-of-the-art LLMs
have bounded input lengths (4K–32K tokens), forcing
truncation of long or multiple concatenated passages
and risking information loss.
4)Index Maintenance: Building and updating retrieval
indices for expansive or rapidly changing corpora
requires substantial storage, compute resources, and
engineering effort.
To address these challenges, recent research has explored
improvements in retrieval, generation, and hybrid architec-
tures:
a) Self-Reflective RAG
Asai et al. introduce an iterative scheme where the model
emits a special token when it detects missing evidence,
triggering a focused second retrieval step to fill in information
gaps.
b) Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT)
Zhang et al. jointly fine-tune the generator with noisy
context by including distractor passages during training,
teaching the model to ignore irrelevant retrievals and reducing
hallucinations.
c) Hierarchical Retrieval
Sarthi et al. propose a coarse-to-fine retrieval pipeline
that first narrows down to document clusters via high-level
summaries, then performs detailed retrieval within selected
clusters, improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy.
d) Knowledge-Graph Augmented Retrieval
Chang et al. combine unstructured text search with struc-
tured graph traversal to enforce entity-centric retrieval paths,
boosting fact-verification performance without additional
generator retraining.
e) Dynamic Routing
Liet al. present a controller that chooses between answer-
ing from the model’s internal parameters or invoking the full
RAG pipeline, reducing latency by bypassing retrieval for
straightforward queries.
f) Index and ANN Optimizations
Advances in ANN libraries (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) and hard-
ware acceleration have lowered retrieval times to single-digit
milliseconds for large embedding collections. Techniques like
cache-aware prefetching and adaptive index sharding further
enhance throughput.

g) Retriever-Generator Co-Training
Izacard et al. demonstrate end-to-end training of retriever
and generator, using generator feedback to refine retrieval
embeddings and improve downstream QA accuracy.
h) Evaluation Benchmarks
Common evaluations include open-domain QA (Natu-
ralQuestions, TriviaQA), multi-hop reasoning (HotPotQA,
MultiRC), and long-form generation (ELI5), measured with
Exact Match, F1, BERTScore, and system-level latency or
throughput.
B. Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)
Cache-Augmented Generation shifts the document re-
trieval step into an offline preprocessing phase, eliminat-
ing runtime lookups and their associated delays. In this
paradigm, a language model is initialized with a “cache”
of preselected passages or their summaries—either loaded
into its context window or stored as layer-wise key–value
representations—before any user queries are processed. Early
experiments demonstrated that models with extended context
lengths (32 k–100 k tokens) could ingest all pertinent materi-
als for a given domain in a single forward pass, matching or
exceeding the accuracy of BM25-based RAG systems while
cutting end-to-end latency by over 40
The core mechanics of CAG involve two stages: context
preloading and key–value cache reuse . First, a selection
algorithm—drawing on query logs, metadata filters, or coarse
embedding retrieval—identifies the subset of documents most
likely to be relevant. These texts are concatenated (or sum-
marized) and passed as an initial prompt, during which
the model computes and stores key–value tensors at each
attention layer. At inference, new queries are appended to
this preloaded sequence, and the model performs a unified
forward pass. Because the expensive encoding of large docu-
ments is amortized across many queries, per-query through-
put approaches that of a standard generative model [1], [2].
Subsequent evaluations have confirmed CAG’s benefits.
Leng et al. applied a 32 k-token model to HotPotQA by
concatenating all supporting paragraphs, observing a 3–5
point BERTScore gain over dense RAG and reducing average
inference time from 1.2 s to 0.7 s per query on identical
hardware [2]. On NaturalQuestions, high-quality document
selection narrowed the accuracy gap to under 1
Nevertheless, fixed context windows impose hard limits.
Even with emerging models supporting up to 128 k tokens,
ingesting web-scale corpora—such as the 3 billion-word
snapshot of Wikipedia—or continuously updated news feeds
remains infeasible [3]. Moreover, the quadratic compute
and memory scaling of standard attention ( O(n2)) makes
very long inputs prohibitively expensive [3]. To address
this, variants like Reformer [4] and Longformer [5] employ
sparse or block-sparse attention patterns to approach near-
linear complexity, albeit with trade-offs in expressivity and
implementation overhead.
Another practical concern is cache staleness. A static
preload reflects the knowledge base at one point in time;
subsequent updates—new research findings, breaking news,or edited reference entries—are invisible until the cache
is rebuilt. Hybrid CAG–RAG architectures mitigate this by
combining a static cache for stable knowledge with on-
demand retrieval for dynamic content. Li et al. introduce
an uncertainty-driven controller that triggers lightweight re-
trieval only when the model’s confidence is low, reducing
retrieval calls by 30
The “lost-in-the-middle” phenomenon further complicates
long-context processing. Liu et al. show that transformer
attention weights diminish for tokens near the midpoint of
very long sequences, leading to degraded performance when
key facts reside away from the ends [7]. In CAG, where
critical information may be buried deep within preloaded
texts, countermeasures include thematic cache segmentation,
learned positional embeddings, or interleaving query markers
to maintain mid-context relevance.
Architecturally, CAG simplifies deployment by removing
dependencies on live search services, vector stores, and in-
dexing pipelines at inference time. This reduction in external
components decreases operational overhead and potential
failure points, making CAG attractive for enterprises with
well-defined internal knowledge stores—legal archives, tech-
nical documentation, or medical records—where compliance
and privacy are paramount.
Looking forward, extending CAG to multimodal
caches—preloading not only text but also visual or
structured data representations—offers a path to richer
reasoning. Techniques such as hierarchical summarization
or reinforcement-learning–based pruning will be crucial to
scale context lengths beyond current token limits without
sacrificing factual integrity.
C. Compression Techniques in LLMs
Language models face a bottleneck when integrating large
amounts of external information into their limited context
windows. As context capacities have expanded—from 4 k
tokens up to experimental 128 k tokens—various context
compression methods have been developed to pack the most
crucial content into each token slot. These approaches aim to
condense or filter input while retaining the evidence needed
for downstream tasks. We outline five principal strategies
below.
a) Extractive Selection
These methods pick and keep only the most relevant sen-
tences or paragraphs, discarding the rest. Simple extractive
pipelines score each segment using sparse or dense retrieval
metrics and select the top kcandidates per query [18].
More advanced systems train lightweight models to predict
how much each sentence will improve answer accuracy;
for example, RECOMP uses a contrastive objective to rank
sentences, achieving 50–70
b) Abstractive Summarization
Abstractive methods generate new, concise text that merges
information from multiple passages. Typically, an LLM fine-
tuned on multi-document summarization corpora fuses re-
lated facts into dense summaries. MetaSummary clusters

retrieved documents and produces one abstractive summary
per cluster, cutting context length by up to 80
c) Token Pruning
Token-level pruning removes individual words or subwords
deemed unimportant. Importance can be measured via at-
tention weights, gradient saliency, or learned gating. For
instance, TokenPrune uses gradient-based saliency to drop
low-impact tokens, yielding 20–40
d) Relevance Filtering
Relevance filtering discards whole passages that fall below
a similarity cutoff. Embedding-threshold filtering removes
any text whose vector similarity to the query is too low
[21]. Alternatively, LLM-driven snippet extraction prompts
the model to isolate answer-bearing text (“Extract the part
of this document that answers the question: . . . ”), yielding
highly precise but sometimes overly narrow contexts [22].
Combining coarse embedding filtering with snippet extrac-
tion balances precision and recall.
e) Hierarchical Compression
Hierarchical schemes organize knowledge into abstraction
layers. RAPTOR, for example, clusters documents into top-
ics, generates high-level summaries for each cluster, and
optionally produces finer summaries for subclusters [13]. At
inference, the model first consults top-level summaries and
descends to detailed nodes only if needed, keeping active
context under 50 k tokens even for large corpora. Hybrid
CAG–RAG systems can cache summaries and fetch full
documents on demand.
f) Integration and Best Practices
State-of-the-art pipelines chain multiple compressors: first
drop unrelated documents, then extract key sentences, gener-
ate abstractive summaries of those extracts, and finally prune
remaining low-saliency tokens [17], [19]. Such multi-stage
workflows can reduce input size by 80
g) Future Directions
Emerging research seeks adaptive compression, where a
controller chooses between extractive, abstractive, or prun-
ing modules per query based on domain and complexity.
Extensions to multimodal contexts will require summarizing
visual and structured data. Advances in efficient attention
(sparse, low-rank, kernel-based) promise to raise context
limits, easing pressure on compression. Finally, compre-
hensive benchmarks measuring compression ratio, factual
fidelity, latency, and energy consumption will guide further
improvements.
III Methodology
In this section, we outline the three principal components
of our system: Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), a
Hybrid CAG–RAG Framework, and Efficient Cache Manage-
ment. Together, these modules enable large language models
(LLMs) to handle expansive, evolving knowledge repositories
while preserving low latency and high fidelity.
A. Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC)
ACC streamlines the preloaded knowledge cache by retain-
ing only the most pertinent information. It comprises three

Ranking, (2) Multi-Level Summarization, (3) Policy Optimization.
coordinated modules: Snippet Ranking, Multi-Level Summa-
rization, and Contextual Compression Policy Optimization.
1) Snippet Ranking
We train a relevance scorer ρ(s, q)that quantifies how well
a snippet s(at sentence, paragraph, or document granularity)
aligns with a query q. Both sandqare encoded using a dual-
encoder model—such as Dense Passage Retrieval [ [4]] or
Sentence-BERT [ [16]]—and compared via cosine similarity.
To adapt to recent queries, we maintain a buffer of the last
Nquery embeddings {qi}and compute:
score( s) =α1
NNX
i=1ρ(s, qi) + (1−α)ρ(s),
where ρ(s)is an offline relevance estimate and α∈[0,1]
balances real-time and precomputed signals. Snippets with
the lowest scores are pruned, leaving only the top k%for
further processing.
2) Multi-Level Summarization
Selected snippets are arranged in a hierarchy—document,
paragraph, and sentence levels. At each tier, a BART-based
summarizer [ [8]] produces fixed-length abstracts following
the maximum-salience objective of [ [17]]. During inference,
we perform a top-down check: if the summary at a given
level meets a relevance threshold, we stop; otherwise, we
descend to finer granularity. This strategy yields up to 75 %
token reduction while preserving over 95 % of task-critical
content.
3) Contextual Compression Policy Optimization
We cast compression as a Markov Decision Process
where states correspond to partially compressed contexts,
actions include pruning or summarizing nodes, and rewards

blend downstream generation quality (e.g., BERTScore) with
token-processing cost. A policy trained via Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) [ [9]] learns to maximize expected utility
under a fixed token budget, outperforming static heuristics by
approximately 5 % F1 on multi-hop QA tasks.
B. Hybrid CAG–RAG Framework
To support continuously growing and frequently updated
collections, we integrate CAG with on-demand retrieval in
three stages.
1) Foundation Context Preloading
We first run ACC on a representative snapshot of the
knowledge base (e.g., product documentation or statutory
texts). The resulting compressed context and precomputed
key–value tensors are stored and reused for all subsequent
queries.
2) Selective Retrieval Augmentation
At inference, a cache-hit detector —a lightweight classifier
trained to compare the query embedding against the cached
snippet embeddings—determines whether the existing cache
covers the query’s needs [ [14]]. On a cache miss, we
use FAISS for dense retrieval [ [5]] to fetch the top- m
new passages, then apply a brief ACC-style summarization
(extractive + sentence-level) before merging.
3) Dynamic Context Integration
Newly summarized passages are appended to the cached
key–value store. If the memory budget is exceeded, the
lowest-scoring segments are evicted to maintain a fixed
context size. The unified context is then fed into the LLM
in a single forward pass, preserving low latency even as the
backing corpus evolves [ [15]].
Fig. 3. Efficient Cache Management: (1) Incremental Updates, (2) Token
Truncation, (3) Segmented Cache Storage.
C. Efficient Cache Management
To maintain a compact, up-to-date cache, we employ three
coordinated strategies.
1) Incremental Updates
We monitor the knowledge base for additions, edits, and
deletions. Only the affected cache segments are reprocessed
using ACC, cutting total offline computation by roughly 70 %
without a full rebuild.
2) Token Truncation
Within each cached snippet, low-impact tokens—identified
via attention or gradient-based saliency scores—are removed
during preprocessing [1], yielding an extra 10–20 % reduction
in token count with minimal effect on output quality.
3) Segmented Cache Storage
Documents are clustered by topic using k-means [2] and
Latent Dirichlet Allocation [3]. The cache is partitioned into
these thematic segments, loading only the relevant clusters
per query. This reduces peak memory usage by 30–40 %
while preserving cache hit rates [4].
D. Summary
By combining selective ACC updates, fine-grained token
pruning, and segment-based cache loading, our system deliv-
ers a scalable, low-latency solution for knowledge-intensive
LLM deployments.
IV Experiments
In this section, we evaluate our proposed methods on
two widely used, knowledge-intensive question-answering
benchmarks: HotPotQA and NaturalQuestions. We begin by
detailing our experimental setup—datasets, baseline systems,
implementation details, and evaluation metrics—and then

chical Summarization, Selective Retrieval, and Segmented Cache Storage,
unified in the LLM inference pipeline.
present quantitative results on answer quality, inference la-
tency, and memory utilization. Finally, we analyze multi-
hop reasoning performance, resource efficiency, and perform
ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component.
A. Experimental Setup
1) Benchmarks
We conduct experiments on:
•HotPotQA [1], a multi-hop QA dataset requiring rea-
soning across two or more Wikipedia paragraphs. It
contains 113 k training examples and 7.4 k development
examples, each annotated with supporting facts.
•NaturalQuestions [2], an open-domain QA benchmark
with questions drawn from Google search logs and
answers as short spans in Wikipedia articles. We use
the short-answer split comprising 80 k training and 8 k
development examples.
2) Baselines
We compare against three state-of-the-art systems:
•Sparse RAG [3]: retrieves the top- kpassages using
BM25 lexical matching and feeds them into a T5-large
generator.
•Dense RAG [4], [5]: employs DPR embeddings for
dense retrieval via FAISS ANN search, followed by the
same generative head.
•Standard CAG : concatenates all supporting documents
that fit within a 32 k-token window, without compres-
sion or hybrid retrieval.
3) Implementation Details
All models are built on the Transformers library [6]. Our
backbone is a 32 k-token variant of the GPT-4 architecture[7], fine-tuned for QA. The DPR dual-encoder [4] is fine-
tuned on each dataset’s question–passage pairs for relevance
scoring. The BART summarizer [8] is trained separately at
document, paragraph, and sentence granularities. The PPO
policy network [9] is a two-layer MLP with 128 hidden
units per layer, trained for 10 k episodes with batch size 32.
Experiments are run on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with inference
latency measured on a single GPU.
4) Metrics
We report:
•BERTScore to evaluate answer quality.
•Inference latency , the 99th-percentile end-to-end time
per query (ms).
•Memory utilization , peak GPU memory usage during
inference (MB).
B. Experimental Results
1) Answer Quality and Latency
As Table I shows, ACC–CAG outperforms both sparse and
dense RAG by 5–10 % in BERTScore on both benchmarks,
demonstrating effective context compression with minimal
information loss. While standard CAG lags by 1–2 % in
quality, it offers lower latency; ACC–CAG closes this gap and
surpasses RAG, maintaining sub-700 ms inference times. The
hybrid ACC–CAG–RAG model further increases BERTScore
by 1–2 points at the cost of a 5–10 % latency increase.
2) Scalability and Memory Efficiency
By compressing 2–3× more content into a 32k-token
window, ACC reduces peak GPU memory by 20–30 %
compared to standard CAG. Hybrid augmentation adds only
a small memory overhead (¡ 15 %).
3) Multi-Hop Reasoning
On HotPotQA, ACC–CAG surpasses dense RAG by 6
points in BERTScore, highlighting the benefit of unified
context management for cross-document inference. The hy-
brid framework achieves the highest multi-hop accuracy by
supplementing cached knowledge with targeted retrieval.
4) Ablation Studies
We evaluate ACC–CAG on HotPotQA by disabling each
component:
•No relevance scoring : random snippet removal reduces
BERTScore by 4 points.
•No hierarchical summarization : sentence-only extrac-
tion lowers BERTScore by 2 points.
•No RL policy : fixed compression cuts BERTScore by 3
points.
These results confirm the importance of each ACC module.
5) Operational Efficiency
Incremental cache updates reduce offline recompression
time by 70 %, while token truncation and segmented storage
cut inference memory by 25 %, supporting deployment in
resource-limited settings.
6) Error Analysis
Analysis on HotPotQA reveals that residual errors of-
ten stem from ambiguous questions or missing external
knowledge. Future work will explore integrating structured
knowledge graphs to address these gaps.

V Conclusion

brid CAG–RAG framework achieve superior QA perfor-
mance with substantially reduced latency and memory de-
mands compared to standard RAG systems, validating their
effectiveness for scalable, low-latency LLM deployments.
