## Abstract
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Abstract
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced information retrieval systems, particularly in response
generation (RG). Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge con-
flicts between internal memory and retrievaled external informa-
tion, arising from misinformation, biases, or outdated knowledge.
These conflicts undermine response reliability and introduce un-
certainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic per-
spective and reveal that when conflicting and supplementary in-
formation exhibit significant differences, LLMs confidently resolve
their preferences. However, when the distinction is ambiguous,
LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this insight, we
propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline

mentation of retrieved information and guiding LLM preference
in response generation. Extensive experiments on single-choice,

eration (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves single-choice
task accuracy by at least 7.54% over competitive baselines.

1 Introduction
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revo-
lutionized information retrieval systems, particularly in retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG). Among these novel technologies,
the response generation (RG) technique [ 21] directs information
accessing with LLMs while bypassing rigid retrieval granularity
and relevance matching. Despite their remarkable effectiveness,
LLMs remain susceptible to hallucinations, making it challenging

to ensure reliability in domain-specific knowledge applications
and knowledge updates. Augmenting LLMs with external infor-
mation has become a mainstream approach to mitigating these
issues [ 3,19,33,42,43]. However, the disparity between the inter-
nal memory of LLM and the retrieved information from the external
sources leads to knowledge conflicts [ 40]. These conflicts are al-
ways caused by misinformation, unreliable sources, and publisher
bias of the retrieved information. Additionally, pre-trained LLMs
themselves may encode inherent biases and outdated knowledge
due to the limitations of their training corpora. The inability to
synchronize LLMs with real-time updates further exacerbates these
discrepancies, leading to contradictions between internal and exter-
nal knowledge. As illustrated in Figure 1, these conflicts introduce
uncertainty in RG [ 37], posing a serious threat to the reliability of
RG tasks and increasing the risk of biased or erroneous inference.
The existing approaches do not fully agree on how LLMs re-
solve knowledge conflicts. Some approaches [ 9,12,38] reveal that
LLMs are inclined to prioritize external context, while others [ 14,
16,23,37] argue that LLMs may rely on their internal memory.
For example, a) LLMs tend to cite external context when internal
priors are weak but resist when strong [ 37]; b) LLMs are highly
receptive to conflicting external evidence if it is coherent and con-
vincing [ 38]; c) Despite external evidence, the LLM sticks to its
flawed internal memory [ 14]. Even worse, the LLM operates in a
black box so the fundamental mechanism of the conflicts of invis-
ible internal knowledge remains difficult to be fully understood,
which is particularly challenging in practice. Therefore, the existingarXiv:2504.12982v1  [cs.CL]  17 Apr 2025

empirical approaches [ 15,40] typically focus on heuristic guide-
lines to improve the reliability of RG but lack a unifying theoretical
framework.
To bridge this gap, we re-examine knowledge conflict in RG from
the perspective of information theory. We analyze how LLMs es-
tablish preferences when faced with conflicting knowledge sources
and observe:
‚Ä¢When the disparity between conflicting and supplementary
information is significant, LLMs confidently settle into a
stable preference.
‚Ä¢When the distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience ex-
treme uncertainty, making their response unreliable.
Building on these insights, we propose Swin-VIB, a Variational In-
formation Bottleneck (VIB) approach with a Sliding window. More
specifically, we leverage a pipeline-based multiple variational infor-
mation bottleneck models [ 2] to adaptively augment the retrieved
information and guide the preference of LLMs for response gener-
ation. This design stabilizes the LLM‚Äôs preference and minimizes
ambiguity, enabling more accurate and consistent responses even
in challenging scenarios with knowledge conflicts. Our major con-
tributions are summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢To mitigate the uncertainty of response generation caused
by knowledge conflicts, we model the interplay between
the internal memory of LLMs and external context and re-
lease the preference principle behind knowledge conflict
in retrieval-augmented LLMs. With significant differences
between conflicting information and supplementary infor-
mation, LLMs have more confidence to settle into a stable
preference, otherwise, LLMs fall into extremely high uncer-
tainty.
‚Ä¢This analysis of LLMs‚Äô preference provides insight into ac-
commodating knowledge conflicts in retrieval-augmented
LLMs. In this way, we propose Swin-VIB, a sliding-window
approach that integrates multiple variational information
bottlenecks to adapt perplexing knowledge, enhancing that
knowledge that can guide the LLMs toward stable preference
and thus accurate response generation.
‚Ä¢Extensive experiments across single-choice, open-ended ques-
tion answering (QA) and RAG, validate our theoretical model
and demonstrate that Swin-VIB outperforms baselines for
reliable response generation in the wild.
These contributions address vital challenges in reliable response
generation, paving the way for more trustworthy and effective gen-
erative information retrieval systems in practice. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach that systematically analyzes
and evaluates knowledge conflicts of LLMs, rather than merely rely-
ing on empirical evaluations, thus enjoying higher interpretability.

2 Problem Analysis
Knowledge conflicts may cause uncertainty in response generation
where LLMs need to make a choice with conflicted knowledge from
the internal memory of LLMs and the external context. Considering
the black-box nature of LLMs, it remains challenging to analyze
1https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Swin-VIB-54F9the fundamental mechanism of these conflicts between invisible
internal knowledge and external contexts. Without a theoretical
analysis of knowledge conflicts, the limitations of empirical rules
and experimental settings in response generation can hardly be
alleviated[ 14,37,38,40]. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
theoretical framework that shows knowledge conflicts can be de-
fined by conditional entropy, achieving an understanding of the
knowledge conflicts of retrieval-augmented LLMs. First of all, the
corresponding symbol system is defined in Table 1.

Figure 2: the relationship between ùúìand the difference be-
tweenùêºùëêandùêºùë†
betweenùêºùëêandùêºùë†, we separate the curve in Figure 2 into three
regions:
‚Ä¢R reliance (Reliance Region) : The LLM exhibits a preference to
lean towards external context, where (ùêºùëê,ùêºùë†)‚ààR2,ùêºùëê‚àíùêºùë†<ùúÇ.
‚Ä¢R confident (Confident Region) : The LLM exhibits a preference
to lean towards internal knowledge, where (ùêºùëê,ùêºùë†)‚ààR2,ùêºùëê‚àí
ùêºùë†>ùúÇ.
‚Ä¢R perplexity (Perplexity Region) : The LLM gets confused due to
high uncertainty about the recalled knowledge and has no
obvious preference, where the difference between ùêºùëêandùêºùë†
approaches a ùë£-neighborhood around ùúÇ.ùë£is a constant that
is defined as a perplexity boundary.
Without considering that the strict prompt templates can also
influence preference, our prompts are benign for LLMs to generate
responses according to retrieved external context [ 37]. We con-
clude the principle of LLMs‚Äô preference on the used information by
Remark 2.1.
Remark 2.1. If the difference between ùêºùëêandùêºùë†is quite large
or small, LLMs maintain stable preference, and achieve response
generation with low uncertainty, i.e.,
√çlim(ùêºùëê‚àíùêºùë†)‚Üí‚àí‚àûùúì=0, ùêºùëê‚àíùêºùë†‚ààR reliance√çlim(ùêºùëê‚àíùêºùë†)‚Üí+‚àûùúì=0, ùêºùëê‚àíùêºùë†‚ààR conflict(7)
Considering the black-box nature of LLMs, the difference be-
tween conflicting information and supplementary information can-
not be quantified explicitly, but we can adapt this type of difference
by observing the trend of the output uncertainty of the LLMs. When
the absolute difference between conflicting information and sup-
plementary information becomes larger, the LLM will intensify its
preference to reduce uncertainty, and thus the output uncertainty
continues a decreasing trend. In this way, we give two optimization
strategies to achieve reliable response generation:
‚Ä¢Acceptation Strategy : Accept the external context if the out-
put uncertainty of LLMs consistently becomes smaller;
‚Ä¢Rejection Strategy : Reject the external context if output un-
certainty does not have an explicit trend;

Figure 3: External information adaption with a bottleneck-
based structure
3 Methodology
3.1 Design Framework
According to the strategies proposed in Section 2, a novel model,
Swin-VIB, is proposed to adaptively compress various information
and extract their differences, which is inspired by the information
bottleneck structure [ 30]. The information bottleneck is an optimal
compression method, consisting of an encoder that reduces the
amount of information and a decoder that makes key inference. In
Swin-VIB, this structure is trained to learn the high-dimensional
association between the difference of conflicting information and
supplemental information and the output uncertainty of LLMs.
Specifically, we randomly set a window to select tokens in an exter-
nal context and extract the corresponding attention scores as the
input representation G(ùëÖ)for bottleneck training:
G(ùëÖ)=ùëÅ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëõ=11
ùëôùëíùëõ|ùúî|‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1S Aùëè(ùúî),whereùúî=win ùëÖ,ùëôùëíùëõ.(8)
win ùëÖ,ùëôùëíùëõdenotes randomly selects a token subsequence of length
ùëôùëíùëõfrom the external context ùëÖ.Aùëõ(ùúî)‚ààR|ùúî|√ó|ùúî|is the attention
matrix produced by the ùëõ-th Transformer decoder block [ 32] for
the window ùúî,ùëÅis the number of blocks. Saggregates the total
attention scores assigned among all token pairs within the window.
The detailed design is present as the following: 1) The encoder
compresses the representation Ginto a latent representation Z,
adaptively discarding irrelevant information while maintaining
difference features correlated to information from internal and ex-
ternal sources; 2) The decoder establishes the relationship between
these difference features and the labeled uncertainty index of the
model output.
Training objectives and process : Our goal is to compress the
amount of information in Gwhile maximizing the reliability of
inference. Therefore, we label Gby symbol Y:
Y=Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥ Ô£≤
Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥1,ifùëÖis unique or the ground true.
0,ifùëÖincludes multiple optional
instances except for the ground true.(9)
This setting makes Yrepresent the uncertainty of the retrieval-
augmented response generation. We include GandYto construct
training datasets for each transformer decoder block.Here, it is by minimizing the mutual information ùêº(G,Z)to guide
the encoder to adaptively learn the key features to identify infor-
mation differences, whereas maximizing the mutual information
ùêº(Z,Y)facilitates the decoder to predict the output uncertainty
based on the latent representation Y:
maxùêº(Z,Y;ùúô)s.t.minùêº(G,Z;ùúÉ), (10)
whereùúÉandùúôare the parameter of the encoder ùëûùúÉ(Z|G)and
the decoder ùëùùúô(Y|Z), respectively. The ability to learn informa-
tion differences is featured in the bottleneck structure during the
training process (see Figure 3). However, G,Y, and Zcan only be
represented by discrete values and Gaussian distributions, resulting
in a severe limitation in model training. Inspired by variational
inference [ 2], the best approximate posterior distribution can be
found by minimizing the KL divergence between distributions. To
further guarantee the loss function trainable, the expectation ùúáùëû
and variance ùúéùëûofZare predicted by the encoder:
Z=ùëü(G,ùúñ)=ùúáùëû(G)+ùúéùëû(G)ùúñ, (11)
whereùëü(¬§)is a reparameterization function [ 17]. Noiseùúñis intro-
duced for constructing the intermediate stochastic vector. So the
optimization objective is defined as:
L=ùêº(Z,Y)‚àíùõΩùêº(Z,G)=ùêª(Y,ùëùùúô(Z))+ùõΩKL(ùëûùúÉ(Z|G)‚à•ùëù(Z))
(12)
whereùëù(g,y)=ùëù(g)ùëù(y|g)can be approximated by the empirical
distribution. ùõΩserves as the bottleneck parameter controlling the
capacity for information compression.
Inference process : The encoder reverses the ability learned
during training to compress the amount of information and eval-
uate the difference of various information, allowing the decoder
to more accurately predict uncertainty. In this way, the strategies
listed in Section 2 are implemented, thereby stabilizing the LLM
preference and accommodating conflicts in retrieval-augmented
response generation with LLMs.
3.2 Swin-VIB
Corresponding to ùëÅgroups of attention scores extracted from ùëÅ
transformer decoder blocks in an LLM [ 32], we cascade ùëÅbottle-
neck structures to form Swin-VIB, incorporating it into the LLM
and facilitate the LLM to generate response. Thus, according to
Formula 12, their loss functions are defined as follows:
Lùëõ=
ùêª(Y,ùëùùúô(Zùëõ))+ùõΩKL(ùëû(Zùëõ|Gùëõ)‚à•ùëù(Z))	ùëÅ
ùëõ=1(13)
The output of all bottlenecks is weighted to achieve an averaging
result for identifying output uncertainty (detailed in Sec. 4.4.1):
ÀÜY=1
ùëÅùëÅ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëõùëùùúô(ùëûùúÉ(G)) (14)
where, if ÀÜYis greater than the threshold ùúâ, it is approximated with
1, otherwise, setting to 0, which is a specific implementation of Y in
Formula 9. This design integrates the information of all Transformer
representations while avoiding any change on the LLM.
In its inference stage, responses are generated by three steps (as
illustrated in Figure 4):
Step 1 (Retrieval) : Relevant contexts are retrieved from external
knowledge according to a query;

Figure 4: An overview of response generation with Swin-VIB.
Step 2 (Augmentation) : We first use LLM to extract the representa-
tion of the external context, G, and then use ùëÅtrained bottlenecks
to perform sliding-window-based inference. The sliding window
dynamically accepts or rejects the context according to the output
of Swin-VIB. Based on empirical experience, we set the window
length to 7. In this way, the tokens in the context are incorporated
into the prompt template. The forward propagation of the varia-
tional information bottleneck requires the introduction of random
noise, we involve two types of randomization methods:
‚Ä¢MonteCarlo method , which obtains a better generalization
effect by randomly sampling;
‚Ä¢Mean method , which discards the variance of the encoder
prediction to obtain fast inference speed.
Step 3 (Response generation) : Reliable responses are generated by
retrieval-augmented LLMs, even in the presence of conflicting in-
formation.
4 Experiments
4.1 Evaluation Setup
4.1.1 Datasets. To evaluate how LLMs handle conflicts and im-
prove the reliability of response generation, two popular public
Question-Answer (QA) datasets, ConflictQA [ 38] and TruthfulQA
[22], are employed.
‚Ä¢ConflictQA is constructed based on the initial memory of
the most popular LLMs (Llama2-7b [ 31], Llama2-70b [ 31],
GPT4 [ 1], Qwen-7b [ 4], and four other LLMs). We take the
key "counter-memory" in ConflictQA to indicate external
contexts that conflict with the internal memory.
‚Ä¢TruthfulQA includes the keys "correct answer" and "incorrect
answer", and contains multiple correct or incorrect contexts
that conflict with each other.
To adapt TruthfulQA for the scenarios with conflicted information,
we use LLMs to select keys among "correct answer" and "incorrect
answer" based on their internal memory. One or two contexts are
randomly taken from the keys that were not chosen by the LLM as
the "counter-memory" key, to follow the usage of ConflictQA.Table 2: Dataset information

the performance of Swin-VIB, we compare Swin-VIB with baselines
on two popular LLMs, Llama2-7B [ 31] and Qwen-7B [ 4]. In detail,
Swin-VIB is configured in terms of various layers and parameters.
ùúâ=0.8,ùõΩ=10‚àí3for ConflictQA, and ùúâ=0.68,ùõΩ=10‚àí4for
TruthfulQA. To establish scenarios with the conflicted information,
we implement three popular tasks with a series of metrics2to
evaluate the performance of Swin-VIB across different tasks:
1) Single-Choice: Single-choice task evaluates the generalization
ability of Swin-VIB and other baselines, by exploring the preferences
of LLM through its choices. Specifically, we provide two options for
each query. One of the options is obtained from the internal memory,
the other is from the external context, and only one of them is
correct. To construct prompt templates with conflict information,
we use the "counter-memory" in the dataset to fill the <conflicting
external context> slots in the prompt template, as shown in Figure
5(a). This prompt template instructs the LLM to select one of the
options to generate responses.
A comprehensive set of metrics is used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of Swin-VIB for single-choice, where ùëárepresents the total
number of instances, and ùêøis the number of instances that the
system handles correctly without intervention. ùê∂ùëü,ùê∂ùë§, andùê∂ùëõcor-
respond to the number of instances with correct, incorrect, and
abandoned answers, respectively. ùê∂ùëêùëúùëüùëüùëíùëêùë° denotes the number of
instances that were initially answered incorrectly but corrected by
Swin-VIB,ùê∂ùëëùëíùëìùëíùëõùë†ùëí represents the number of results that resisted
misleading influences and achieved correct answers, ùê∂ùëöùëñùë†ùëôùëíùëéùëë indi-
cates the number of initially correct answers that become incorrect
due to misleading or confusing information, and ùê∂ùëúùë£ùëíùëüùëêùëúùëõùëìùëñùëëùëíùëõùëêùëí
refers to the number of results maintaining confidence in incorrect
answers. The following is a detailed description of the metrics:

ùëá) and Abandon-
ment Rate ( AR=ùê∂ùëõ
ùëá) measure the proportion of correct,
incorrect, and abandoned answers. We quantify the uncer-
tainty of the LLM by Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô , which is equal to‚àí(ùê¥ùê∂ùê∂ log2(ùê¥ùê∂ùê∂+

sures the information uncertainty of the LLM in handling
specific inference tasks so that it can effectively approximate
the uncertainty value ( U).ùúñis a small constant used to avoid
numerical issues in logarithmic calculations.
‚Ä¢Correction Rate ( CR=ùê∂ùëêùëúùëüùëüùëíùëêùë°

used to measure the uncertainty in the LLM‚Äôs ability to cor-

ing information.
‚Ä¢Resistance Rate ( RR=ùê∂ùëëùëíùëìùëíùëõùë†ùëí
ùêø) measures RG system‚Äôs resis-
tance to incorrect information. The calculation method of
HùëÖùëÖis similar to that for Hùê∂ùëÖ.

ùëá‚àíùêø) counts the instances the LLM
is overconfident on incorrect information. Similarly, HùëÄùëÖ
andHùëÇùëÖare also calculated by following the similar method
above.
2) Open-Ended QA : The open-ended task aims to evaluate Swin-
VIB‚Äôs capability to maintain high-quality and reliable response
generation under conditions where the context includes potential
conflicting information. For each query, we utilize the key "counter-
memory" in the dataset to fill the slot <conflicting external context>
in the prompt template (see Figure 5(b)).
To evaluate the performance of Swin-VIB on Open-Ended QA,
we utilize BLEU-4 [ 24], METEOR [ 7], and CHRF [ 25] to evaluate
the linguistic accuracy and relevance of the generated responses,
which consider n-gram overlap, synonymy, and character-level pre-
cision and recall. The key "ground truth" in ConflictQA and the key
"best answer" in TruthfulQA are used as the ground truth used for
evaluation.
3) Improving RAG Systems with Swin-VIB : This task aims to
explore the improvements in generation performance and efficiency
of RAG systems with Swin-VIB. We evaluate various performance
metrics of RAG systems on database TruthfulQA. To implement the
seamless integration of Swin-VIB into existing RAG frameworks, an
Elasticsearch-based retrieval system [ 10] with an embedding modelnamed by m3e-base [ 35] and a database named by TruthfulQA is
constructed. Specifically, for each query, we retrieve the top five
correct or incorrect responses to fill the slot <conflicting external
context> in the corresponding templates (see Figure 5(c)). A com-
prehensive set of metrics followed by benchmark RAGAS [ 11] is
used in this task, including similarity, correctness, relevance, and
faithfulness. Finally, we use the key "best answer" in TruthfulQA
as the ground truth for the performance evaluation of Swin-VIB in
RAG.
4.2 Empirical Verification of LLM‚Äôs Preference
Figure 6: Distributions of LLM-generated responses with dif-
ferent LLM preference when a different type of external
information is provided, and the corresponding uncertainty
(Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô) for each case.
To verify the finding in Section 2, we explore the preferences
of LLMs through the single-choice task. The uncertainty of the
output, Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô corresponding toU, is investigated by adapting the
types of external information. Two types of external information
are involved: a) Conflicting context: The ‚Äúcounter-memory‚Äù key in
ConflictQA contains explicit conflicting information. b) Supplemen-
tary context: A query prompt, ‚Äú<query> A:<option a> B:<option b>
Please answer the supplementary knowledge that is not related to
option A and option B based on the query‚Äù, is used to make GPT-
4o [1] generate different amount of supplementary information
In this way, we conduct the following experiments (see Figure 6):
‚Ä¢For case (1), replacing 50% external information with con-
flicting context to simulate an RG system with significant
conflicting information, pushing the LLM into the confident
region.
‚Ä¢For case (2), increasing the proportion of the conflicting
context to 100% and simulating more significant information
difference. Results show that Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô decreases, while RR and

becomes more confident in its internal memory.
‚Ä¢For case (3), taking 50% supplementary context to simulate
a RG system with significant supplementary information,
pushes the LLM into a reliance region.
‚Ä¢For case (4), to enhance this instance that the supplementary
context is more than conflicting information, the proportion
of the supplementary context is increased to 100%. The re-
sults show that Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô decreases, while CR and MR increase,
and the LLM has firm confidence in its internal memory.
These observations verify our findings about the relation between
output uncertainty of LLMs and the information difference, which
determines LLM preferences.

4.3 Experimental Results on Different Tasks
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of Swin-VIB on three
tasks: single choice, open-ended QA, and improving RAG Systems
with Swin-VIB.Table 6: Experimental results on the open-ended QA task.

4.3.1 Single Choice. We compare Swin-VIB with 4 baselines in-
cluding Naive LLM, Naive RAG, TACS [ 45], and Rowen-CL [ 8].
From Table 3 and Table 4, we can make the following observations:
(1) Swin-VIB achieves SOTA in almost all metrics, especially the
ACC on TruthfulQA is improved by 7.54% for Llama2-7b, and is
improved by 11.88% for Qwen-7B. In Table 4, Swin-VIB achieves the
smallest output uncertainty compared to other baselines, indicating
that it can adapt knowledge differences and reduce uncertainty
significantly. (2) As CR increases, Hùê∂ùëÖdecreases. Meanwhile, if MR
decreases, HùëÄùëÖalso decreases. This demonstrates that Swin-VIB
rejects the external context with high uncertainty, and thus shows
resilience to incorrect external information. (3) On conflictQA, HùëÖùëÖ
also increases, showing that the LLM lacks confidence in its ability
to resist incorrect external information. In this case, although the
LLM seems confused, RR is significantly improved by Swin-VIB,
since Swin-VIB can distinguish the uncertainty of the LLM output
and ensure reliable accuracy.
As shown in Figure 7, Swin-VIB has significantly improved ACC.
At the same time, the AR decreases, which validates that Swin-
VIB can alleviate LLMs‚Äô hesitation, and reduce the probability to
abandon answering. Furthermore, as shown in Table 5, the decrease
inHùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô verifies smaller output uncertainty of the LLM.

4.3.2 Open-ended QA. To evaluate the negative impact of Swin-
VIB on the authenticity and coherence of the responses generated
by the original LLM, we implement a task of Open-ended QA. Com-
pared to Naive RAG, the involved sliding window mechanism of
Swin-VIB may lead to the inconsistency of external context and even
worse logical errors. To explore whether Swin-VIB has a negative
impact on the original LLM, we compare the responses generated
by the LLM with Naive RAG and those from the LLM with Swin-VIB
in scenarios with conflicting information. Table 6 shows these two
methods have similar evaluation results across BLEU-4, METEOR,
and CHRF. This reveals that the process for the external context
adaptation by the sliding window does not affect the authenticity
and coherence of the response generation quality. On the other
hand, Figure 8 illustrates the distribution of the evaluation results
on Llama2-7B with Swin-VIB. These evaluation results concentratemore on the higher values, which means Swin-VIB has even better
performance in response generation. The external context adap-
tion of Swin-VIB is beneficial to reduce the uncertainty of LLM
output. In addition, we measure the instance-level information en-
tropy of generated responses. We calculate this type of entropy by
the following formula, ‚àí√çùëö
ùëñ=1ùëù(ùë§ùëñ)log2ùëù(ùë§ùëñ), whereùëù(ùë§ùëñ)de-
notes the probability of occurrence of the word ùë§ùëñin the response
andùëöis the total number of distinct words of instance-level re-
sponse. Figure 9 shows the LLM with Swin-VIB responses have
lower entropy, qualifying the instance-level response generation.
All of these observations ensure that the quality improvement of
response generation is attributed solely to Swin-VIB‚Äôs design.
4.3.3 Improving RAG Systems with Swin-VIB. In this subsection,
we demonstrate the enhancement of Swin-VIB in the RAG system.
Swin-VIB seamlessly integrates with the RAG system and remains
sufficiently lightweight. To evaluate the effectiveness of Swin-VIB
in the RAG task, we compare Swin-VIB and Naive RAG (shown in
Table 7):
‚Ä¢The improvements in answer correctness demonstrate Swin-
VIB‚Äôs ability to provide reliable responses. This is due to
more stable preferences helping the LLM select external
information even when introducing the top 5 contradicted
contexts.
‚Ä¢The slight improvement in the similarity and relevance of the
generated responses indicates that Swin-VIB guides the LLM
to integrate internal and external knowledge while aligning
closely with the query‚Äôs intention.
‚Ä¢The decrease in faithfulness suggests that the response gen-
eration does not rigidly follow the retrieved information.

This implies that the sliding window mechanism can effec-
tively filter the confused context, rather than simply using
all retrieved information.
In terms of efficiency, we evaluated the impact of the Swin-VIB
plugin on RG delay for two LLMs, Llama2-7B, and Qwen-7B, as
detailed in Table 8. For Llama2-7B, Swin-VIB gets an average delay
of 0.3913 seconds for the mean method and 3.5613 seconds for Mon-
tecarlo method. Qwen-7B experienced similar increases of 0.3874
seconds (mean method) and 3.5922 seconds (Monte Carlo method).
The mean method presents a minimal delay increase, optimal for
time-sensitive applications, while the Monte Carlo method, though
slower, enhances robustness for more complex scenarios. Swin-VIB
thus offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy, suitable for
diverse operational contexts.

4.4 Model Analysis
4.4.1 Convergence Evaluation. As shown in Figure 10(a), the loss
function of our bottleneck structure stabilizes around 200 epochs,
illustrating its efficient convergence during bottleneck training. Weexplore the bottleneck training on a validation dataset in terms of
the following two metrics:
‚Ä¢Attention Score: It indicates how attention dynamics come
to be stabilized. It applies logistic regression to calculate
the F1 scores for layers in each transformer and performs
normalization on the obtained F1 scores. The stable attention
score verifies the capability of the LLM to accommodate the
conflicting information.
‚Ä¢Mean Squared Error (MSE): We calculate MSE of the pre-
dictions of each bottleneck and the ground truth. The small
MSE indicates the conflicting information is accommodated.
The attention Score values come to stable except for several bottle-
necks that suggest challenges in handling conflicting information.
Figure 10(b) and Figure 10(c) show that we need to adapt bottle-
necks with the corresponding Transformers. Meanwhile, deeper
features tend to reduce the need for dynamic attention adjustment.
4.4.2 Parameter Analysis. We change the bottleneck parameter
of Swin-VIB, ùõΩ, from 10‚àí2to10‚àí6to study its effect on response
generation. Figure 11 demonstrates the ACC and Hùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô fluctuate
with different ùõΩ, as well as a negative correlation between ACC
and uncertainty, validating our approach can minimize uncertainty
through external information adaption. On dataset ConflictQA,
a narrower bottleneck ( ùõΩ=10‚àí6) can more effectively compress
information representation, improving response quality. In contrast,
On dataset TruthfulQA, the best accuracy is achieved at ùõΩ=10‚àí5,
but declined when ùõΩ=10‚àí6. These observations confirm that
the configuration of the bottleneck parameters effect the output
uncertainty and thus has on impact on the response generation
quality of the LLM with Swin-VIB.
5 Related Works
Efforts to mitigate risks associated with these conflicts in RG can
be broadly categorized into two groups: a) Internal knowledge-
driven methods [ 3,6,20,28,29,34,44,46] enhances the LLMs‚Äô
awareness of potential conflicts independently by fine-tuning with
updated knowledge; b) External-validation methods [ 5,8,13,18,
33,36,39,43] incorporate verification steps to ensure the reliability
of retrieved contexts.

Conference acronym ‚ÄôXX, June 03‚Äì05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.
However, existing methods have limitations in fully elucidating
LLMs‚Äô preference mechanisms: a)Internal catastrophic forgetting of
LLMs caused by fine-tuning [ 40]; b)External validation always leads
to overconfidence in external sources, and thus degrades the LLMs‚Äô
inference precise [ 38]. In contrast, we propose a novel RG method
[21], Swin-VIB. It only uses internal attention scores to guide the
training of external reliability enhancement modules, without any
change of the pre-trained LLMs. On the other hand, Swin-VIB adapts
conflicted knowledge, avoiding solely relying on internal or external
information. A bottleneck-based adapter is involved to regulate the
compression ratio of the retrieved information and optimize the
posterior distribution of the LLM-empowered response generation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time information
bottleneck theory is used to adapt data representations.
6 CONCLUSION
This work proposes a novel theoretical framework to analyze and
address the issue of information conflicts encountered by LLMs in
RG systems. Leveraging analysis on the knowledge conflicts and
preferences of LLMs from an information theory perspective, we
find that the uncertainty of LLMs can be mitigated by adapting the
external information difference of LLMs. Insighted by this, we pro-
pose Swin-VIB to optimize how RAG handles external contexts to
achieve reliable response generation. Experimental results demon-
strate that Swin-VIB significantly accommodates conflicts, reduces
uncertainty in LLM outputs, and generates more accurate, consis-
tent, and context-aware responses. Moreover, Swin-VIB enhances
retrieval system performance, facilitating its real-world applica-
tions. Future work will explore extending this approach to more
types of response generation tasks to further validate and enhance
its effectiveness.
