## Abstract
We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing
the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius
comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136
multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain
experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each
question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling
transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231
foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from
seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and
adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging
from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models
achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs
in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant
performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example,
"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\%
with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in
authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our
knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

Abstract
We introduce ESGenius , a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the
proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in Environmental, Social and Governance
(ESG) and sustainability-focused question an-
swering. ESGenius comprises two key com-
ponents: (i) ESGenius-QA , a collection of
1,136 MCQs generated by LLMs and rigor-
ously validated by domain experts, covering
a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainabil-
ity topics. Each question is systematically
linked to its corresponding source text, en-
abling transparent evaluation and supporting
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) meth-
ods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus , a meticu-
lously curated repository of 231foundational
frameworks, standards, reports, and recom-
mendation documents from 7authoritative
sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capa-
bilities and adaptation potential of the model,
we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol— Zero-Shot andRAG . Extensive ex-
periments across 50LLMs (ranging from 0.5B
to 671B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-
the-art models achieve only moderate perfor-
mance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55-70%, highlighting ESGe-
nius’s challenging nature for LLMs in interdis-
ciplinary contexts. However, models employ-
ing RAG demonstrate significant performance
improvements, particularly for smaller models.
For example,“DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 14B”
improves from 63.82% (zero-shot) to 80.46%
with RAG. These results demonstrate the ne-
cessity of grounding responses in authoritative
sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To
the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first
benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies, focusing on ESG
and sustainability topics.
1 Introduction
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
knowledge encompasses a vast domain of sustain-ability and corporate responsibility information that
LLMs must effectively process to serve emerg-
ing business needs. This field spans across crit-
ical agendas from climate change and emissions
tracking (IPCC, 2023), to workplace safety and
human rights (Global Reporting Initiative, 2023).
Such knowledge is codified in numerous technical
frameworks and standards—major ones including
GRI (Initiative, 2023), SASB (Board, 2023), TCFD
(Board, 2017), ISSB(International Sustainability
Standards Board, 2023), and CDP (CDP World-
wide, 2023)—which are constantly evolving.
While LLMs show promise in processing com-
plex ESG documents and providing relevant an-
swers to user queries, their capabilities in this in-
terdisciplinary domain remain largely unevaluated .
Considering the high stakes involved, where incor-
rect responses about ESG requirements or metrics
could lead to serious compliance violations or mis-
guided sustainability initiatives, this lack of assess-
ment is particularly problematic. However, there
exists no comprehensive question-answering
(QA) benchmark specifically designed to eval-
uate how well LLMs understand and reason
about ESG concepts . Most existing QA datasets
either completely omit ESG topics or address them
superficially. This gap leaves researchers and prac-
titioners without a reliable way to measure and
improve LLMs’ ESG knowledge comprehension
and question-answering abilities.
To close this gap, we present ESGenius , a cu-
rated benchmark that targets MCQ-QA as the core
evaluation task for ESG and sustainability knowl-
edge. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) ESGe-

ics, generated through SOTA LLM approaches and
validated by domain experts. Each question is ex-
plicitly mapped to supporting evidence from au-

a top score of 72.54%, as shown in Figure 1.
However, models demonstrate substantial potential
for improvement through RAG approaches, with
“DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 14B” improving from
63.82% (zero-shot) to 80.46%. (4) Open Source

edge resources, question-answering benchmarks,
and retrieval-augmented generation; Section 3 de-
tails the construction of the ESGenius benchmark,
describing both the ESGenius-QA dataset and the
ESGenius-Corpus ; Section 4 outlines our exper-
imental protocols—including zero-shot and RAG
settings—and presents a comprehensive evaluation
of 50 LLMs; Section 5 discusses the benchmark’s

current limitations and avenues for future exten-
sion; and Section 6 concludes the paper and high-
lights directions for subsequent research.
2 Related Work
This section reviews relevant literature across three
key areas in using LLMs for ESG benchmarking,
including knowledge sources, QA benchmarks and
RAG.
2.1 ESG & Sustainability Knowledge
Resources
ESG data have traditionally been guided by vol-
untary reporting frameworks such as the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (SASB). These frame-
works define taxonomies of ESG topics (e.g., emis-
sions, labor practices, board governance) and in-
dicators, but the unstructured text in corporate
sustainability reports poses significant challenges
for computational use. To impose structure, re-
searchers have proposed ontologies and knowledge
bases for ESG. For instance, (Zhou and Perzylo,
2023) introduced OntoSustain , aligning GRI and
EU standards to capture key sustainability indica-
tors, though broad coverage and automated popula-
tion remain difficult.
Several ESG-focused text corpora have emerged
to support NLP research in this domain. One re-
cent example is SusGen-30K , a dataset of 30k in-
stances spanning multiple financial NLP tasks (e.g.,
sentiment, Q&A) and an ESG report generation
task (Wu et al., 2024). Meanwhile, (Chang et al.,
2024) built a benchmark labeling sentences from
corporate sustainability reports covering 36 ESG
topics. These datasets remain relatively restricted,
especially compared to general-domain corpora,
and focus primarily on classification or generation
tasks rather than MCQ question answering, thus
motivating the need for broader coverage like ES-
Genius .
Prior NLP work on sustainability texts has
largely centered around information extraction and
text classification. Early methods relied on topic
models or lexicon-based approaches (Raghupathi
and Raghupathi, 2020), but these often fell short in
capturing nuanced ESG terminology. More recent
efforts leverage LLMs. For instance, (Bronzini
et al., 2023) employed a GPT-based pipeline to
extract triples ( company, action, ESG issue ) from
sustainability disclosures, populating a knowledgegraph covering 500+ ESG topics. Similarly, (Mar-
odon et al., 2022) unveils SDG Prospector , an AI-
driven DistilRoBERTa NLP tool that mines 237
public development banks’ 2016-2020 reports to
expose which Sustainable Development Goals dom-
inate their strategic narrative.
Researchers have also developed specialized lan-
guage models for ESG. (Webersinke et al., 2021)
introduced ClimateBERT , continuing BERT’s pre-
training on 1.6M climate-related paragraphs, en-
abling more effective classification of risk dis-
closures. In industry, (Ni et al., 2023) proposed
ChatReport , which uses GPT-based summarization
and semantic search to assess a company’s report
against TCFD recommendations. These domain-
specific approaches illustrate the promise of LLMs
for ESG tasks but also highlight the need for stan-
dardized benchmarks for a thorough evaluation.
2.2 QA & Evaluation Benchmarks
Question answering (QA) benchmarks have driven
many NLP advancements over the past decade,
starting with the TREC QA tracks (V oorhees and
Tice, 2001) and continuing through datasets like
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). While these re-
sources predominantly test general factual or read-
ing comprehension, specialized QA datasets have
emerged to measure higher-level reasoning and do-
main expertise. For example, OpenBookQA (Mi-
haylov et al., 2018) challenged models to com-
bine a small “open book” of scientific facts with
common sense, while BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019)
featured yes/no queries requiring nuanced text un-
derstanding. Datasets such as DROP (Dua et al.,
2019) emphasize discrete reasoning skills, involv-
ing counting or arithmetic over paragraphs.
Further expansions include large-scale evalua-
tion suites like MMLU (Massive Multitask Lan-
guage Understanding) (Hendrycks et al., 2021),
covering dozens of subjects at college exam level,
and domain-specific tasks such as PubMedQA (Jin
et al., 2019) for biomedical research. Despite these
efforts, there remains a dearth of QA benchmarks
devoted to ESG and/or sustainability. Thus, ES-
Genius fills in this gap with a large set of expert-
validated MCQs spanning across environmental, so-
cial, and governance topics. By drawing from com-
prehensive frameworks (e.g., IPCC, GRI, SASB),
ESGenius offers a high-stakes, real-world testbed
that is specific to ESG.

2.3 RAG and Knowledge Grounding
When tackling specialized or dynamically updated
domains, RAG has emerged as a powerful method
for accurate and interpretable QA. Lewis et al.
(2020) introduced RAG , an approach that com-
bines a parametric language model with a non-
parametric memory of documents. This approach
improved performance on knowledge-intensive QA
tasks (e.g., NaturalQuestions) relative to purely
parametric models, as it allows the LLM to ground
responses in retrieved evidence.
Other retrieval-generation frameworks such as
Fusion-in-Decoder (Izacard and Grave, 2021) and
REALM (Guu et al., 2020) illustrated diverse strate-
gies for fetching relevant text chunks to guide the
model’s reasoning. Recently, these methods have
been applied to high-stakes sectors including fi-
nance and climate science. For instance, Vaghefi
et al. (2023) integrated GPT-4 with a 3,000-page
IPCC report to answer climate change questions
more accurately. Similarly, Ni et al. (2023) used
semantic search to retrieve TCFD-related segments
from a company’s sustainability report, prompting
an LLM to summarize potential climate risks. This
grounding is critical in ESG contexts, where trace-
ability and authoritative references are essential.
3 The ESGenius Benchmark
Developing reliable AI tools for the complex ESG
and sustainability domain requires high-quality,
domain-specific data. Our ESGenius benchmark
provides a comprehensive foundation to evaluate
and enhance LLMs in this context. It is designed
to encompass the key dimensions of ESG, drawing
from globally recognized standards and authorita-
tive sources. The benchmark comprises two in-
terconnected components: ESGenius-QA , a chal-
lenging question-answering dataset covering envi-
ronmental, social, and governance topics with ex-
plicit linkages to textual evidence; and ESGenius-
Corpus , encompassing a diverse collection of au-
thoritative sources in ESG and sustainability. The
detailed coverage of sources and statistics are pre-
sented in Appendix D.
3.1 ESGenius-QA
QA Generation and Validation Principles. The
ESGenius-QA dataset comprises 1,136 carefully
curated multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with
ground truth answers, validated by ESG domain ex-
perts. The questions systematically cover essentialESG topics across three core pillars: (i) Environ-
mental: Climate change mitigation and adapta-
tion, comprehensive carbon accounting (Scope 1,
2, 3 emissions), energy efficiency, water resource
management, biodiversity conservation, waste re-
duction, and pollution control; (ii) Social: Labor
practices and standards, human rights protection,
diversity and inclusion initiatives, workplace health
and safety, community engagement and impact as-
sessment, data privacy and protection; (iii) Gov-
ernance: Board structure and independence, ex-
ecutive compensation frameworks, business ethics
and compliance, shareholder rights and engage-
ment, enterprise risk management, and regulatory
adherence. The dataset is generated through our
specialized pipeline (detailed in Appendix A.1) and
undergoes rigorous validation by domain experts
to ensure accuracy and relevance, as described in
3.1.
Descriptions. The ESGenius-QA dataset is
structured to reflect the complexity and diversity
of real-world ESG assessments through a standard-
ized multiple-choice format. Each question con-
tains four options (A-D) with a single correct an-
swer, plus a dedicated “Not sure” option (Z) to
assess model uncertainty. This design enables sys-
tematic evaluation of both performance and confi-
dence. The dataset carefully balances conciseness
with domain-specific precision: questions and op-
tions employ precise ESG terminology while main-
taining clarity and focus, with contextual prompts
provided where necessary for essential background.
The specialized lexicon throughout authentically
represents real-world ESG assessment scenarios.
Table 1 presents a detailed token-level analysis of
questions, options, and source text. Key termi-
nology distributions are visualized through word
clouds for the source text (Figure 4), questions
(Figure 2), and answer options (Figure 3).
Corpus-Question Mapping. Each question in
ESGenius-QA is precisely mapped to relevant
page(s) and text passages within authoritative
source documents (GRI, SASB, IPCC, etc.) con-
taining the information required for correct an-
swers. ESG domain experts meticulously annotate
these mappings, ensuring both accuracy and rele-
vance. This explicit linking between questions and
their supporting evidence in source texts enables
effective RAG approaches.

QA Quality Control. To ensure the highest qual-
ity of questions and answers, we implement a rig-
orous multi-stage validation process. After initial
generation through our LLM pipeline mentioned
in Appendix A.1, each question is assigned to do-
main experts. These experts carefully validate that:
(1) the question-answer pair is correct according
to authoritative sources, (2) the question is clearly
worded and tests meaningful domain knowledge,
(3) distractors are plausible but unambiguously in-
correct, and (4) sufficient context is provided where
needed. Questions failing any validation criteria
are either refined or removed from the dataset.
3.2 ESGenius-Corpus
TheESGenius-Corpus underpins every evaluation
in this work, unifying authoritative frameworks,
corporate questionnaires, and peer-reviewed scien-
tific assessments that span the full breadth of envi-
ronmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns.
A quantitative snapshot of the collection appears
in Table 3 for IPCC climate-science assessments,
Table 4 for the GRI Standards, Tables 5–6 for
SASB’s industry-specific disclosures, Tables 7–8
for IFRS/ISSB guidance, Table 9 for TCFD materi-
als, Table 10 for CDP questionnaires, and Table 11
for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These
statistics confirm (i) broad topical coverage across
all three ESG pillars, (ii) deep sector-level granu-
larity via SASB industry standards, and (iii) an ex-
panding climate-finance focus through IFRS-ISSB,
TCFD, and CDP additions.
Sourcing and Collection. The corpus integrates
sources along three tiers: (1) Core reporting
standards include the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) Standards (Initiative, 2023), Sustainabil-
ity Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Stan-
dards (Board, 2023), and International Sustainabil-
ity Standards Board (IFRS-ISSB) Standards (Inter-
national Sustainability Standards Board, 2023); (2)
Specialized reports and frameworks extend cover-
age with IPCC Assessment Reports (IPCC, 2023),
TCFD Guidelines (Board, 2017), and CDP ques-
tionnaires (CDP Worldwide, 2023); and (3) Over-
arching global targets are provided by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations,
2015).
Extensibility. The architecture is deliberately
modular, allowing rapid incorporation of emerg-
ing regulations (e.g., EU CSRD, ISSB updates),
sector-specific guidance (e.g., sustainable financetaxonomies), and certification frameworks. This
forward-looking design safeguards the bench-
mark’s relevance as the ESG landscape evolves,
ensuring that ESGenius remains a reliable yard-
stick for measuring LLM progress on sustainability
understanding.
Copyrights and Privacy Handling. The
ESGenius-Corpus comprises publicly available
documents and open-access materials. For
proprietary standards and frameworks (e.g.,
GRI, SASB, CDP), we provide references to
their official source locations, allowing users to
access them directly, with only brief excerpts
referenced for academic purposes. The corpus
documentation explicitly lists included sources and
provides detailed guidance on accessing external
materials, ensuring reproducible research while
adhering to intellectual property rights. To protect
privacy, the corpus excludes all personal and
sensitive information through a rigorous filtering
process - sections containing individual employees,
survey respondents, or contact information are
systematically removed. The dataset’s anonymity
is verified through both automated filters and
comprehensive manual auditing.
4 Experiments and Results
Through ESGenius , we benchmark 50LLMs span-
ning open-source checkpoints—DeepSeek (Guo
et al., 2025), Meta-Llama 3 (Grattafiori et al.,
2024), Google Gemma 3 (Team et al., 2025), and
Alibaba Qwen 2.5/3 (Yang et al., 2024, 2025) from
Hugging Face(Hugging Face, 2024) and Trans-
formers library(Wolf et al., 2020)—as well as pro-
prietary APIs (GPT, DeepSeek, Qwen-Max). All
experiments run on a DGX A100 node (4 ×80 GB
A100 GPUs) with fixed random seeds ( SEED =42)
for reproducibility. Our evaluation suite com-
prises two progressively stronger settings: (1) Zero-
shot prompting (§4.1.1), which probes the intrin-
sic ESG knowledge encoded during generic pre-
training, and (2) Long Context RAG (§4.1.2), a
RAG baseline that prepends relevant evidence to
each prompt as long context. The RAG experi-
ments are conducted on 43 open-source models.
For each model–setting combination, we com-
pute exact-match accuracy on single-answer ques-
tions. Since LLMs may return raw responses
that do not directly conform to our required for-
mat, we perform response validation to ensure
valid multiple-choice answers (see details in Ap-

pendix A.2). This produces comprehensive leader-
boards in Table 2 for both zero-shot and RAG ap-
proaches (full results in Appendix C Table 2).
4.1 Evaluation Protocols
4.1.1 Zero-Shot Prompting
Inference Protocol. Each model is provided the
canonical question template (see Appendix B) and
an example zero-shot question is shown in Ap-
pendix A.3. Response generation employs greedy
decoding ( temperature =0,top_p =1,top_k =0),
with a maximum sequence length of 1024 tokens.
Implementation. Models are evaluated in half
precision (FP16) using standard batched inference
on GPU. Results are logged incrementally with
error handling to ensure robustness.
4.1.2 Long Context RAG
Retrieval Protocol. For each question, the pre-
linked source text from ESGenius-QA is retrieved
from the ESG knowledge corpus. This text serves
as context, prepended to the prompt template (see
Appendix B.2) and an example zero-shot question
is shown in Appendix A.3. This simple but effec-
tive approach ensures that models have access to
relevant domain knowledge during inference.
Implementation. The evaluation pipeline closely
mirrors the zero-shot setup, with the key differ-
ence being the augmented prompts. We imple-
ment context injection by prepending the retrieved
source text to each question prompt before feeding
it to the model. The same decoding parameters
(temperature =0,top_p =1) and evaluation met-
rics are used.
4.2 Main Results
Drawing from the experimental results presented
in Table 2, we highlight three key findings and
provide detailed analysis in the following sections.
4.2.1 Key Findings
(1)ESG Concept Understanding Remains Chal-
lenging for Current LLMs . Our evaluation re-
veals that the top-performing model, “o3”, attained
an accuracy of 0.7254 , whereas the majority of
other models scored approximately 0.65. This per-
formance level is notably comparable to, or lower
than, that observed in benchmarks from other do-
mains (Guha et al., 2023), underscoring the chal-
lenges current LLMs face in accurately compre-hending and reasoning about complex ESG con-
cepts. Further details are provided in Section 4.2.2.
(2)Smaller Models Augmented with Domain-
Specific RAG Can Surpass Larger Zero-Shot
Models. Performance evaluation demonstrates that
applying RAG significantly enhances the capabil-
ities of smaller models on ESG question answer-
ing. For example, the accuracy of “Qwen3 4B”
increased from 0.6188 (zero-shot) to 0.7905 us-
ing RAG. Similarly, “Qwen2.5 1.5B” rose from
0.5484 (zero-shot) to 0.6972 . These improvements
demonstrate that targeted retrieval is more effective
than raw model scale for complex domain-specific
knowledge.
(3)Reasoning Capabilities Enhance LLM Per-
formance on ESG Understanding. Models aug-
mented with explicit reasoning capabilities demon-
strate enhanced performance on ESG tasks com-
pared to non-reasoning models of comparable scale.
For instance, the reasoning variant of “o3” attained
an accuracy of 0.7254 , exceeding the scores of sim-
ilarly sized models without such enhancements (see
Figure 1). This underscores the significant bene-
fit derived from incorporating reasoning-focused
mechanisms into LLMs for specialized domains.
More details in Section 4.2.4.
4.2.2 Challenging Nature of ESGenius
Our comprehensive evaluation, detailed in Ta-
ble 2 (see Appendix C), reveals that the ESGenius-
QA dataset is highly challenging for a broad
range of contemporary LLMs. This includes pro-
prietary APIs such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o (Zero-
shot: 0.6364), DeepSeek models (“DeepSeek-R1”
Zero-shot: 0.6629; “DeepSeek-V3” Zero-shot:
0.6532), and Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max (Zero-shot:
0.6444), as well as leading open-source families
like Meta Llama (e.g., “Meta-Llama-3 8B” Zero-
shot: 0.6461), Google Gemma (e.g., “Gemma-3
12B with instruction tuning” Zero-shot: 0.6514),
and Alibaba Qwen (e.g., “Qwen2.5 14B” Zero-
shot: 0.6734). The best zero-shot performance in
the table is 0.7254 from the proprietary “o3” model,
while the highest RAG-enhanced score is 0.8336
with the open-source “Gemma-3 27B with instruc-
tion tuning” model. This gap underscores both the
discriminative nature of ESGenius and the bench-
mark’s heightened ESG reasoning demands.
4.2.3 RAG Performance
Integrating ESG-specific knowledge through long
context RAG frequently yields substantial per-

formance gains over zero-shot capabilities. For
instance, the “DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen” se-
ries demonstrates significant improvements across
model sizes: the 1.5B model improves by 37.36%
(0.3134 to 0.4305), the 7B model by 29.63%
(0.5018 to 0.6505), and the 14B model by 26.07%
(0.6382 to 0.8046). Other notable examples include
“Gemma-3 27B” (non-instruction-tuned), which
achieves a remarkable 141.57% improvement
(0.2165 to 0.5229), and “QwQ 32B” with a sub-
stantial 95.23% increase (0.3900 to 0.7614). Simi-
larly, “Qwen3 4B” improves by 27.75% (0.6188 to
0.7905), and the instruction-tuned “Qwen2.5 1.5B”
model increases by 27.13% (0.5484 to 0.6972).
However, RAG does not universally enhance per-
formance. Some models actually perform worse un-
der the RAG configuration in this study—notably,
“Qwen2.5 0.5B” (standard) shows a slight decline
of 1.14% (0.5458 to 0.5396), while its instruction-
tuned counterpart experiences a more significant
7.48% decrease (0.5775 to 0.5343). These re-
sults indicate that RAG’s effectiveness is closely
tied to model architecture and intrinsic capabili-
ties, though it generally enables smaller models to
surpass the zero-shot performance of their larger
counterparts.
4.2.4 Reasoning Models Analysis
Table 2 flags “Reasoning Focus” (Rea: Yes) mod-
els. Those explicitly oriented or fine-tuned for
reasoning, such as “DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen”
and “DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama” (Open Source)
and proprietary offerings like “o3” (300B, Rea:
Yes, ZS: 0.7254) or “o4-mini” (3B, Rea: Yes, ZS:
0.6945), frequently excel in zero-shot mode. For
example, the reasoning-oriented “DeepSeek-R1-
Distill-Qwen” series shows strong RAG perfor-
mance and gains (14B model: 0.8046, 1.5B model
improves by 37.36%), while “QwQ 32B” (Rea:
Yes) also achieves a 95.23% improvement under
RAG. Comparisons with non-reasoning peers re-
inforce this pattern. For instance, “o4 mini” (3B,
Rea: Yes) reaches 0.6945 zero-shot, well above
non-reasoning 3B models such as “Llama-3.2
3B” (ZS: 0.6074) or “Qwen2.5 3B” (ZS: 0.5889).
These observations suggest that training or architec-
tural choices emphasizing reasoning bolster ESG
question-answering, especially for multi-step logi-
cal tasks.4.2.5 Instruct-Tuned Models Analysis
Our analysis of instruction-tuned models (marked
“I-T: Yes” in Table 2) reveals varied performance
in zero-shot settings. Several models demonstrate
clear benefits from instruction tuning: Google’s
“Gemma-3 1B” improves substantially from 0.2421
to 0.5000, while “Gemma-3 27B” shows an
even more dramatic increase from 0.2165 to
0.6356. Similar positive trends appear in Alibaba’s
“Qwen2.5 0.5B” (0.5458 to 0.5775) and Meta’s
“Llama-3.2 1B” (0.3609 to 0.5986). However, in-
struction tuning can also lead to performance degra-
dation in some cases: “Meta Llama-3.1 8B” de-
clines from 0.6699 to 0.6382, “Qwen2.5 1.5B”
drops from 0.6391 to 0.5484, and “Qwen2.5 14B”
decreases from 0.6734 to 0.6197. The impact of
instruction tuning becomes particularly interest-
ing when combined with RAG. In this context,
instruction-tuned models frequently demonstrate
superior improvement margins compared to their
standard counterparts. For instance, the instruction-
tuned version of “Gemma-3 12B” achieves 0.8380
(28.64% improvement) while its non-instruction-
tuned variant reaches only 0.6857 (5.26% improve-
ment). Similarly, the instruction-tuned “Llama-3.1
8B” attains 0.7993 (25.24% improvement) com-
pared to the standard model’s 0.7650 (14.20% im-
provement). While instruction tuning may not con-
sistently enhance zero-shot performance, its impact
becomes particularly interesting when combined
with RAG. In this context, instruction-tuned mod-
els frequently demonstrate superior improvement
margins compared to their standard counterparts.
4.2.6 Error Analysis
Sorting the heat-map (see Section 4.2.7) columns
by failure rate exposes a long tail of adversarial-
grade questions that no model answered correctly.
Appendix C.1 reproduces three such zero-accuracy
questions. Question 432 from the SDG 2024
Report probes subtle regional disparities in per-
capita renewable electricity capacity. Question 635,
drawn from IPCC AR6 WG III , asks for the sin-
gle most direct barrier to ESCO adoption; mod-
els consistently mis-attributed the bottleneck to
regulation or awareness, missing the report’s em-
phasis on asymmetric information and split incen-
tives within firms. Question 1006, based on the
SASB Chemicals standard, tests the definition of
a recordable workplace incident. Two broad error
patterns emerge across these and similar questions:
first, a tendency to rely on surface keyword overlap

between prompt and distractor, and second, over-
generalisation to well-known policy frameworks
when a question hinges on a narrower ESG stan-
dard. These observations align with the substantial
performance gains reported under RAG (§4.2), un-
derscoring the necessity of grounding model out-
puts in the correct source material.
4.2.7 Interactive Visualization
Figure 7 presents an interactive heat-map visualiza-
tion of model performance across 50 LLMs (rang-
ing from 0.5 to 671 billion parameters) and all
1,136 MCQs in ESGenius . The visualization ar-
ranges models (rows) by their overall zero-shot
accuracy and questions (columns) by difficulty, cre-
ating a clear left-to-right progression from predom-
inantly red cells (incorrect/unanswered questions)
to green cells (correct answers). Interactive fea-
tures enhance analysis - hovering over any cell
reveals detailed information including the model
name and rank, question ID, difficulty score, com-
plete prompt, answer options, ground truth, and
the model’s prediction. An example of this inter-
active tooltip is shown in Figure 8. This dynamic
visualization transforms raw accuracy data into an
intuitive diagnostic tool for analyzing model per-
formance patterns and systematic weaknesses. The
interactive visualization is publicly accessible at
https://angel-ntu.github.io/ESGenius/ .
5 Limitations
While ESGenius aspires to provide a holistic eval-
uation of ESG understanding, several caveats must
be acknowledged:
•Coverage trade-offs ——the benchmark cov-
ers only seven sources, which may not com-
prehensively cover all ESG topics and sus-
tainability issues. While these sources rep-
resent key frameworks and standards, they
exclude many specialized industry guidelines,
regional regulations, and emerging sustain-
ability frameworks.
•Expert dependency —crafting high-fidelity
questions and validating answers hinges on
scarce domain specialists, which introduces
both capacity limits and potential disciplinary
bias. The specialized nature of ESG expertise
makes scaling the question creation process
especially difficult.•Format constraints —standardized multiple-
choice questions facilitate large-scale scoring
but compress the nuanced reasoning and syn-
thesis often required in real-world ESG analy-
sis. This format may not fully capture the com-
plexity of real-world sustainability decision-
making.
•Standard volatility —frameworks such as
ISSB guidance and IPCC assessments evolve
quickly, obliging continual corpus refreshes
and version control to stay current. This rapid
evolution makes maintaining benchmark rele-
vance an ongoing challenge.
•Limited language —the present focus on En-
glish, globally dominant standards risks under-
representing regional regulations and non-
English corpora, potentially missing impor-
tant local sustainability contexts and practices.
•Modality gaps —the text-only design excludes
visual disclosures (e.g., charts, geospatial
maps) and time-series data that are central
to many ESG reports, limiting the bench-
mark’s ability to test comprehension of multi-
modalities.
•Simplified scoring —binary accuracy over-
looks partial correctness and fails to credit
sophisticated but incomplete reasoning, call-
ing for finer-grained metrics that can better
capture nuanced understanding.
•Copyright limits —licensing restrictions pre-
clude the inclusion of certain proprietary
ESG standards, thereby limiting the potential
for truly exhaustive coverage and potentially
missing key industry-specific frameworks.
6 Conclusion
We presented ESGenius , the first benchmark ded-
icated to probing LLMs on the breadth and depth
of ESG and sustainability knowledge, unifying au-
thoritative standards, corporate questionnaires, and
scientific assessments into a multi-dimensional QA
dataset. A two-stage evaluation protocol— Zero-
Shot followed by RAG —reveals that grounding re-
sponses in curated evidence boosts accuracy by
roughly 15–30 percentage points, and that 4 to 72
billion parameter models equipped with targeted
knowledge can surpass much larger zero-shot mod-
els, underscoring the primacy of domain integra-
tion over sheer scale. Looking ahead, we aim to

incorporate emerging regulations, automate corpus
refreshes, extend coverage to non-English sources,
and design finer-grained metrics that capture partial
credit and nuanced ESG reasoning. Overall, ES-
Genius is designed to serve as a dedicated bench-
mark to facilitate the development of sustainability
knowledge-aware AI systems in the complex ESG
domain.

Appendix
A ESGenius-QA
A.1 Automated Preparation of Candidate
MCQs
This appendix details the fully-automated prepa-
ration stage that converts raw knowledge sources
into a pool of candidate multiple-choice questions
(MCQs). (The complete algorithm is detailed in
Algorithm 1.) These candidate questions subse-
quently undergo expert review, editing, and valida-
tion before potential inclusion in ESGenius-QA .
The goals of the preparation stage are twofold: (i)
breadth —to cover as many distinct passages as pos-
sible from the source corpus, and (ii) difficulty —to
generate questions that force LLMs to reason be-
yond surface-level facts.
Input corpus. Documents are first collected from
authoritative sources in PDF format. Each PDF is
then processed independently via the pipeline to
enable precise tracking of corpus coverage. For
encrypted PDFs, the pipeline attempts in-memory
decryption where possible; if decryption fails, the
file is skipped with a warning. Throughout process-
ing, the system maintains detailed logs of extracted
page counts and flags any instances of unsupported
encryption formats.
Text extraction and chunking process. Using
PyPDF2 (Fenniak et al., 2022), every page’s text is
cleaned (whitespace collapse and control-character
stripping) and stored in a page map. A chunk se-
lector then samples passages that satisfy length
constraints
150≤ |chunk| ≤4500 characters ,
optionally concatenating the next page when the
combined length remains under the upper bound.
Each chunk is tagged with its page span (e.g.
“12–13”) so that provenance is preserved.
Prompted multiple-choice question generation.
For every selected chunk the pipeline sends a care-
fully engineered prompt (see A.1) to the Qwen
Max’s DashScope endpoint1that requests exactly
one“extremely challenging” MCQ. Mandatory in-
structions enforce (i) deep reasoning across mul-
tiple sentences, (ii) near-miss distractors, (iii) an-
swerability from the excerpt alone, and (iv) strict
1qwen-max-2025-01-25 , temperature 0, deterministic for
reproducibility.JSON output. A fixed seed ( 42) controls chunk
sampling so that runs are reproducible.
Structural validation and metadata augmen-
tation. The returned JSON is sanitised, parsed,
and validated. Missing or malformed keys trig-
ger rejection. The correct answer text is cross-
checked with the declared key, and a fallback cor-
rection is applied if necessary. A universal Zop-
tion (“Not sure”) is appended to every item to en-
able abstention analysis. Each validated MCQ
is wrapped in a metadata envelope containing
{id, source_pdf, page_range, difficulty,
generation_timestamp} .
Iterative difficulty refinement process. Because
the pipeline aims for a target zero-shot accuracy
of≤50% on an external evaluator (we use Qwen
Max as the evaluator), it performs up to 15 iterative
refinement rounds to achieve this threshold:
1.Test the current pool; label each MCQ with
the model’s chosen answer and correctness.
2.Remove questions that the evaluator answers
correctly.
3.Replace the removed questions by sampling
new chunks and repeating the generation step,
maintaining the original pool size.
4.Abort early if (a) accuracy falls below the tar-
get, (b) authentication errors reach the thresh-
old (default 5), or (c) no new valid chunks
remain.
Consistency checking and question de-
duplication. Beginning with round 2 the
pipeline checks that an MCQ’s evaluator result is
stable across rounds; inconsistent questions are dis-
carded. After refinement, a pairwise LLM-based
similarity check removes near-duplicate questions
that probe the same underlying concept. Only the
first occurrence is retained.
Output artifacts generation and storage. Two
JSON files are written atomically after every pro-
cessed PDF: all_candidates_untested.json
stores every syntactically valid question, whereas
final_round_tested.json retains only the post-
refinement pool together with evaluator metadata.
Incremental saves ensure that partial progress sur-
vives crashes, and IDs are globally unique across
sessions.

Transition to expert review process. The re-
sulting candidate pool is then passed to the expert
review process detailed in Section 3.1. This marks
the transition from automated preparation to rig-
orous human validation and refinement of each
question.
Exact Prompt Template
Context: Based *only* on the following text excerpt from page(s) {page_range} of the document '{doc_name} ':
'''
{text_excerpt}
'''
Task: Generate ONE **extremely challenging** multiple-choice question (MCQ)
with a target difficulty level of '{difficulty} 'specifically designed to be difficult for advanced LLMs like Qwen-Max.
The question must rigorously test deep comprehension, critical reasoning, inference, and synthesis *strictly* based on
the provided text excerpt. Avoid simple factual recall.
**Mandatory Instructions for Difficulty:**
1. **Question Focus:** The question must target subtle details, implicit relationships, logical consequences,
nuanced comparisons, or the underlying purpose/function of specific information within the text. It *must* require
synthesizing information from *multiple distinct sentences or points* within the excerpt.
2. **Distractor Design (CRITICAL):** Create highly plausible but definitively incorrect distractors. These distractors
should:
* Be semantically very close to the correct answer or other concepts in the text.
* Represent common misconceptions or logical fallacies related to the topic, *but be directly contradicted by
the provided text*.
* Exploit potential ambiguities or require careful reading to identify subtle inaccuracies.
* Avoid being trivially wrong or easily eliminated. All options (A, B, C, D) should seem plausible on a
superficial reading.
3. **Avoid External Knowledge:** The question MUST be unambiguously answerable *solely* from the information
contained within the provided text excerpt. The difficulty must come from the complexity of reasoning *within* the text,
not from needing outside information.
4. **Direct Questioning:** The text of the generated `question `itself must **not** contain phrases like
"Based on the text excerpt", "According to the document...", "In the provided context...", etc. Frame the question
directly about the content.
5. **Advanced Strategies:** Employ techniques like identifying cause-effect relationships only implied,
analyzing the necessity or sufficiency of conditions mentioned, or evaluating the scope/limitations
of claims made in the text. Carefully consider using negation/exception questions ("Which of the following is NOT...")
only if they significantly increase cognitive load beyond simple recall.
**Self-Correction Check (Internal Thought Process before outputting):** Does this question *genuinely* require
multi-step reasoning or deep inference based *only* on the text? Are the distractors *truly* deceptive and require
careful analysis of the excerpt to disprove? Is it significantly harder than a simple keyword search
or basic comprehension question?
Output Format: Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
"question": "String: The extremely challenging question text (must not refer to the prompt or text source).",
"options": { "A": "String: Highly plausible but incorrect
Option A.", "B": "String: Highly plausible but incorrect Option B.", "C": "String: The single, unambiguously correct
answer based *only* on the text.", "D": "String: Highly plausible but incorrect Option D." },
"correct_answer_text": "String: The exact text of the correct answer option (must match one of the options exactly).",
"correct_option_key": "String: The key ( 'A','B','C', or 'D') corresponding to the correct answer."
}
**Important:** Ensure the `correct_option_key `points to the option that IS the correct answer. Randomize the position
of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D). Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting like
```json ... ```before or after the JSON object. Output *only* the JSON.

A.2 LLM’s Raw Response Validation
Given an LLM’s raw response, the routine first
guards against NONE or empty inputs, then accepts
“Z” directly as the special unsure option. For other
strings it proceeds in two stages:
Direct acceptance: If every character in the
trimmed string is drawn from {A,B,C,D} , return
the deduplicated, sorted set (e.g., “ DCB”→“BCD”).
Robust cleanup: Otherwise the string is san-
itized: (i) replace all non-alphabetic symbols by
spaces, (ii) drop any word containing lowercase
letters, (iii) retain only words composed of A–D,Z .
The result is deduplicated and sorted as above. If
the cleaned string is empty, contains a lone “Z”, or
mixes “Z” with other letters, the function outputs
INVALID_ANSWER_MARKER .
This design accepts the minimal valid alphabet
while aggressively filtering free-form text, punctu-
ation, and lower-case distractors that often appear
in LLM generations, to guarantee that the response
is a valid multiple-choice answer.

D ESGenius-Corpus
The corpus integrates authoritative frameworks,
corporate questionnaires, and scientific assess-
ments that comprehensively cover environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) considerations. A
detailed quantitative overview of the collection is
presented across multiple tables: Table 3 summa-
rizes IPCC climate-science assessments, Table 4
covers GRI Standards, Tables 5–6 detail SASB’s
industry-specific disclosures, Tables 7–8 outline
IFRS/ISSB standards and guidance, Table 9 cat-
alogs TCFD materials, Table 10 documents CDP
questionnaires, and Table 11 captures UN Sustain-
able Development Goals content. The distribution
of pages and questions across these sources is vi-
sualized in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. From
this comprehensive dataset, several key insights
emerge:
1.Breadth versus depth. Altogether, these
seven sources comprise 231 distinct docu-
ments spanning approximately 19,600 pages .
While bodies such as SASB and IFRS/ISSB
each contribute dozens of relatively concise
files, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) anchors the corpus with just
seven reports that total over 10,000 pages.
2.Standards-driven core. Internationally rec-
ognized ESG standards and disclosure frame-
works—GRI, SASB, IFRS/ISSB, TCFD, and
CDP—form the backbone of ESGenius . They
reflect the most widely adopted practices for
sustainability reporting, management, and
climate-risk disclosure, offering a robust foun-
dation for both quantitative and qualitative
benchmarking.
3.Disclosure and reporting frameworks.
Market-facing reporting initiatives (SASB,
GRI, TCFD, CDP) collectively emphasize
implementation guides and sector- or topic-
specific questionnaires, resulting in many in-
dividual questions but fewer pages per doc-
ument. This modular structure facilitates
domain-specific data collection and compa-
rability across diverse industries.
4.Science-heavy climate assessments. IPCC
assessment reports present the opposite pat-
tern: fewer individual documents but ex-
tremely high page counts. This science-heavy
text ensures deep coverage of climate-changefundamentals, impacts, and mitigation path-
ways—an essential knowledge base informing
the standards and regulations in the broader
ESG ecosystem.
5.Sustainable development anchor. The UN’s
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) un-
derpin cross-sector and cross-country sustain-
ability objectives. Although comparatively
compact in page count, these seminal UN
publications situate corporate ESG strategies
within the global 2030 Agenda, ensuring
broader alignment with international devel-
opment priorities.
6.Imbalanced density highlights practical
challenges. Marked disparities between the
distribution of documents and the distribution
of pages underscore the varied scope of ESG
sources: some (e.g. IPCC) are exhaustive sci-
entific compendiums, while others (e.g. GRI,
SASB, IFRS) comprise slimmer but more nu-
merous reference standards. For researchers
and practitioners alike, tasks ranging from
large-scale summarization to specialized tech-
nical queries must navigate this imbalance of
item count versus depth.
Taken together, these characteristics demonstrate
thatESGenius provides both the breadth (multiple
standards, guidance, and scientific anchors) and the
depth (tens of thousands of pages) required for eval-
uating advanced language models on ESG-focused
reasoning, retrieval, and generation tasks. Future
expansions will incorporate emerging disclosure
rules and further national or sectoral guidelines,
maintaining the corpus’s comprehensive coverage
over time.

Table 8: Comprehensive metadata for the entire IFRS / ISSB sustainability-disclosure corpus (2023–2025): it
comprises the universal core standards IFRS S1 (general sustainability-related financial disclosure) and IFRS S2
(climate-related disclosure), their bases for conclusions, accompanying guidance, the 2024 climate-progress report,
the 2024 Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy, the 2025 greenhouse-gas exposure draft (with basis), a comparison
ofIFRS S2 with the TCFD recommendations, and the 68-volume IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance that maps
SASB’s sector-specific materiality into the new framework. Together the 77 PDFs, total 20.81 MB , span 1 866
pages —well over two thousand when including ancillary matter—and yield 238benchmark MCQs for ESGenius .
IFRS S1 sets the universal disclosure baseline, while IFRS S2 details climate-specific metrics, mirroring the TCFD
architecture and enriched with SASB’s sectoral depth; the accompanying materials establish a globally consistent,
investor-focused baseline that links decision-relevant sustainability information—such as greenhouse-gas emissions,
transition plans, climate resilience, data security, and workforce diversity—directly to financial statements. All
documents are freely available at https://www.ifrs.org/ .

Table 11: Comprehensive metadata for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) corpus
incorporated in ESGenius : the set begins with the 2015 adoption texts—the 19-page plain-language overview of
the 17 Goals and the 41-page General Assembly resolution “Transforming Our World” that enshrines the 2030
Agenda—then follows implementation through the Secretary-General’s Progress towards the SDGs 2024 and the
flagship SDGs Report 2024 , is complemented by the UN Office for Partnerships’ SDG Briefing Book 2023 and
deepened by thematic analyses such as UNDRR’s 2023 Global Assessment Report on Resilience (GAR) and the
independent Sustainable Development Report 2024 with its widely cited SDG Index and global dashboards. Across
these seven key PDFs—totalling 73.33 MB ,735 pages , and distilled into 37benchmark MCQs that anchors national,
corporate, and investor sustainability strategies in the universally agreed 17-goal framework. Full SDG resources
are freely available at https://sdgs.un.org/goals .

Figure 2: This cloud visualizes the 1,136 question stems after filtering generic fillers. Dominant terms such as
“disclosures”, “climate-related”, “sustainability”, “accurately”, and “IFRS” reveal that the questions emphasize
reporting frameworks and precision in interpreting ESG guidance. The prominence of verbs like “described”,
“outlined”, and “reflects” indicates a consistent demand for higher-order reasoning (e.g., identifying relationships,
implications, or best interpretations rather than simple fact recall).
Figure 3: The aggregate vocabulary of the 5,680 answer choices centers on the same core ESG-reporting nouns that
dominate the source text—“emissions,” “entity,” “organization,” “energy,” “water,” “risks,” and “reporting”—but
it is studded with decisive qualifiers such as “without,” “due,” “exclusively,” “primarily,” and “regardless.” These
modifiers reveal how distractors are engineered: they adjust scope, responsibility, or conditionality to make each
option plausible while still allowing only one to satisfy the nuanced criteria posed by the question.

Figure 4: Drawn from the reference excerpts linked to each question, this word cloud highlights the knowledge
backbone behind the benchmark. Key nouns—“entity”, “organization”, “emissions”, “energy”, “water”, “reporting”,
“standards”—underscore the dataset’s strong focus on corporate disclosure obligations, accounting boundaries
(Scope 1/2/3 GHG), and resource-specific metrics. Frequent technical modifiers such as “financial”, “material”,
“percentage”, “management” show that passages often quantify impacts or prescribe measurement criteria, aligning
with the analytical depth expected of the MCQs.

Figure 5: Relative question distribution (benchmark MCQs) derived from each source family. In contrast to the
page distribution, questions are more evenly spread: the largest contributors are IFRS/ISSB ( 20.9 % , 237 Qs) and
SASB ( 20.8 % , 235 Qs), followed by GRI ( 17.7 % , 201 Qs) and CDP ( 16.3 % , 184 Qs). TCFD ( 10.8 % , 122 Qs)
and IPCC ( 10.3 % , 116 Qs) provide focused climate-risk and climate-science coverage, while the SDG set supplies
a compact but essential sustainability anchor ( 3.3 % , 36 Qs).

Figure 6: Relative page-count distribution of the ESGenius-Corpus across its 7 source families. The Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) alone accounts for a majority of the material— 54 % , or10 582
pages —reflecting the encyclopaedic scope of its assessment reports. Standards and disclosure frameworks contribute
smaller but still substantive shares: CDP ( 10.1 % , 1 987 pp.), IFRS/ISSB ( 9.5 % , 1 866 pp.), SASB ( 9.5 % , 1
864 pp.), and GRI ( 9.3 % , 1 826 pp.). Guidance-oriented sources such as TCFD ( 3.7 % , 728 pp.) and the UN
Sustainable Development Goals corpus ( 3.8 % , 735 pp.) round out the collection.
