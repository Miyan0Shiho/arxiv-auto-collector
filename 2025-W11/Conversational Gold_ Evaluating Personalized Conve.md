## Abstract
The rise of personalized conversational search systems has been driven by
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling these systems to
retrieve and generate answers for complex information needs. However, the
automatic evaluation of responses generated by Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems remains an understudied challenge. In this paper, we introduce a
new resource for assessing the retrieval effectiveness and relevance of
response generated by RAG systems, using a nugget-based evaluation framework.
Built upon the foundation of TREC iKAT 2023, our dataset extends to the TREC
iKAT 2024 collection, which includes 17 conversations and 20,575 relevance
passage assessments, together with 2,279 extracted gold nuggets, and 62
manually written gold answers from NIST assessors. While maintaining the core
structure of its predecessor, this new collection enables a deeper exploration
of generation tasks in conversational settings. Key improvements in iKAT 2024
include: (1) ``gold nuggets'' -- concise, essential pieces of information
extracted from relevant passages of the collection -- which serve as a
foundation for automatic response evaluation; (2) manually written answers to
provide a gold standard for response evaluation; (3) unanswerable questions to
evaluate model hallucination; (4) expanded user personas, providing richer
contextual grounding; and (5) a transition from Personal Text Knowledge Base
(PTKB) ranking to PTKB classification and selection. Built on this resource, we
provide a framework for long-form answer generation evaluation, involving
nuggets extraction and nuggets matching, linked to retrieval. This establishes
a solid resource for advancing research in personalized conversational search
and long-form answer generation. Our resources are publicly available at

1 Introduction
Conversational information seeking provides a natural and intu-
itive way for users to interact and discover relevant information
through dialogue with an agent [ 9,32]. Large Language Mod-
els (LLM s) [15] have taken us one step further to having access
to Conversational Search Agents ( CSAs) (e.g., ChatGPT, BingChat,
Gemini, and BlenderBot). Moreover, wide-scale research and devel-
opment in this area is more possible than ever, given the relative
accessibility of the technology. However, despite advances and
having numerous resources available for evaluating LLM s over a
variety of tasks, CSAs present their own unique evaluation chal-
lenges [ 3]. The complexity of CSAs stems from their interactive
and nature [ 10]. Conversations can evolve in various ways with
varied discourse [ 29] and mixed initiatives [ 7]. On top of that, con-
versational interactions are expected to be more personalized and
tailored to the user than standard search systems [44].
LLM s have greatly influenced how IR research is shaped [ 8].
Evaluation has been one of the main themes in the latest IR strate-
gic meetings [ 8], highlighting the impact of LLM s on the way we
consume and evaluate information. This has led to increased com-
munity engagement in LLM s-based evaluation [ 4,17,35,39] leading
to ongoing workshops like LLM4Eval [ 33,34] and Eval4RAG.1Cur-
rent research emphasizes on the importance of evaluating Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and its challenges [35, 37].

TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) [ 29] ran for four
years, aiming to provide a strong evaluation framework for conver-
sational information-seeking tasks. TREC Interactive Knowledge
Assistance Track (iKAT) 2023 [ 5] took a step further, providing com-
plex decisional tasks that require multi-turn collaborative human-
agent interactions. TREC iKAT 2023 also incorporated the personal
knowledge graph in each dialogue, representing the noisy knowl-
edge of the system about the user. Multiple TREC tacks in 2024
such as TREC RAG,2iKAT,3and NeuCLIR4focused on providing
reusable RAG collections, highlighting the importance and signifi-
cance of this research direction.
RAG evaluation faces several challenges as the nature of the task
is complex and multi-step, which has resulted in a multitude of
possible configurations [ 4]. Given that the generated response of
aRAG system is a mix of the retrieved documents and the LLM ’s
internal knowledge, existing surface-based QA metrics are not ideal
for evaluation [ 35]. Besides, existing RAG collections offer more
complex information needs, as opposed to ad-hoc retrieval and
QA [ 37], calling for measuring the completeness of the generated
responses. Existing research builds [ 25,31,37,38] on the ideas of
nugget-based evaluation for summarization [ 18], where the gener-
ated response is broken into information nuggets and compared
against a set of gold nuggets for the information need. However,
most prior work relies on LLM-generated nuggets, without having
studied the effectiveness of LLM-based nugget extraction, poten-
tially leading to unforeseen pitfalls and biases.
To address these limitations, in this work, we present experi-
ment and extend the resources we created in TREC iKAT 2024. In
particular, we present a set of complex multi-turn conversational
topics, assessed for document relevance by the NIST assessors. We
also collect human-extracted information nuggets from the rele-
vant documents, along with a human crafted gold response (given
the nuggets). We then conduct extensive experiments on the ef-
fectiveness of LLM-extracted nuggets in comparison with human
nuggets. Furthermore, we conduct a crowd-sourced human nugget
matching study to assess both different LLMs’ nugget matching
capabilities, as well as end-to-end RAG evaluation. Based on our
experiments and collected data, we propose a novel extensible RAG
evaluation framework, called CONE-RAG , which could effectively ex-
tract and match nuggets of a RAG response, and measure multiple
nugget- and surface-based metrics. We publicly release conversa-
tional topics, document relevance assessments, human nuggets,
gold responses, crowdsourced nugget matching labels, and CONE-
RAG. We believe that our experiments and provided resources will
foster research in conversational RAG and nugget-based evaluation,
as it provides useful insights on the problem.
2 Related Work
Development and evaluation of the interactive CSA is an interesting
perspective in Information Retrieval ( IR). The existing research [ 12–
14,27,29,41–43] tried to facilitate the development of conversa-
tional search systems by proposing standard test collections. The
TREC Interactive Track (1998–2002) [ 27] and the TREC Dynamic
2https://trec-rag.github.io/
3https://www.trecikat.com/
4https://neuclir.github.io/Domain Track (2015–2017) [ 41–43] provided resources for passage
retrieval across multiple rounds of feedback, focusing on itera-
tive refinement rather than conversational interactions. The TREC
Conversational Assistance Track ( CAsT ) [12–14,27,29,41–43] was
one of the first attempts to provide resource for conversational
search task. The track ran over four years resulting in TREC CAsT
2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 test collections. The track evolved over
four years by (1) making the conversations more complex, longer,
and more dependent on the previous user–system interactions, (2)
adding mixed-initiative interactions (clarification, feedback, elicita-
tion, and etc) and (3) making the conversations multi-path based
on different trajectories. These efforts resulted in more realistic and
challenging conversational search scenarios.
The TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track ( iKAT ) [5]
evolved the TREC CAsT into a new track by making the conver-
sations personalized. In personalized search given the same user
query, the response of the system would be different to different
users with different personas. The TREC iKAT 2023 enhanced the
conversations with the persona of the users and added more com-
plex information needs. The persona of the user is provided as a
set of natural language sentences and is static during the conver-
sation. The system needs to do reasoning over context, persona,
and different sources of information to respond to the complex
information needs. The MTRAG collection focuses on the evalua-
tion of multi-turn RAG systems by providing manually collected
and simulated topics. However, the dataset lacks a benchmark for
passage retrieval. In this work, we propose the TREC iKAT 2024
collection which includes the resources for passage retrieval and
response generation over personalized search.
Despite the advancements in RAG systems and response gener-
ation task by the appearance of LLM s, the evaluation of the RAG
systems still remains a challenge. The reference-based metrics such
as Rouge [ 23] and BLEU [ 30] are commonly used to evaluate RAG
systems by measuring the overlap between generated responses and
reference texts, assessing lexical similarity and relevance in terms of
precision, recall, and n-gram matching. One line of research focus
on using LLM s for evaluation of RAG systems [ 16,21,36,45,46].
The BERGEN [ 35] tool evaluates the RAG systems by measuring
the reference-based and LLM-based metrics. Another line of re-
search [ 31,37] is attracted to the nugget-based evaluation of the
RAG systems. ICAT is an evaluation framework designed to as-
sess the coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text
generation. It decomposes the generated text into atomic claims,
verifies each claim by retrieving information from a reliable knowl-
edge source, and evaluates the alignment between these claims and
the key aspects expected in the output. Nugget-based evaluation
has been first proposed in TREC Question Answering Track in
2003 [ 40]. The TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Track [31] tries to automate nugget-based evaluation with the aid
ofLLM s to automatically extract and assign the nuggets. In this
work, we propose both manually collected and LLM-based nuggets
of information for the TREC iKAT 2024 collection. In addition, we
propose an automatic pipeline for extracting the nuggets of infor-
mation from the input text (can be either a response or a passage),
matching them with the set of gold nuggets, and measuring the
nugget recall and precision metrics for conversational search.

3 Resources
The goal of TREC iKAT is to advance the evaluation of the personal-
izedCSAs. To this aim, the track breaks the task of CSAs into three
distinct components including (1) passage retrieval, (2) classification
of the user persona, and (3) response generation. In this work, we
provide resources for different components of a CSA by extending
the existing resources from [ 5] and [ 6], and by providing an auto-
matic framework for evaluation, called CONE-RAG , of the quality of
responses generated by RAG systems. In addition, we provide LLM -
based resources for different components of the personalized CSA.
We categorize and divide our resources into four groups, namely,
(1) human-annotated resources collected by both NIST assessors
and crowdsourcing, (2) resources collected by the aid of LLM s, (3)
our new RAG evaluation pipeline ( CONE-RAG ), and (4) participants
runs. We will further explain these resources in the following.
3.1 Human-Annotated Resources
Personalized conversational topics. The TREC iKAT 2024 col-
lection includes 17 topics and each topic is associated with one
distinct PTKB (persona). Different from iKAT 2023 collection, one
dialogue is developed for each topic to cover a larger array of topics
and have a more diverse set of topics. In total, the dataset includes
218 user–system turns where each dialogue on average has 12.82
user–system turns. Each user–system turn of the conversation in-
cludes (1) user utterance, (2) resolved user utterance, (3) canonical
response grounded on the passages from collection, (4) response
provenance, and (5) PTKB provenance. The topics include longer
and more complete responses compared to the TREC iKAT 2023
collection. The average length of canonical responses is 95.29 words
while it is 77.26 for the iKAT 2023 collection.
For topic development, we mainly followed the same procedure
and guidelines used for the development of the TREC iKAT 2023
collection (see [ 5]) with some modifications. During the topic de-
velopment, we discarded the topics that were deemed too easy or
too difficult, based on a preliminary GPT4 relevance assessment.
We used the automatic relevance judgment model proposed by [ 2]
for relevance assessment of personalized CSAs.
Collection. We use the existing collection from TREC iKAT 2023
which is a subset of ClueWeb22-B [ 28] and includes 116,838,987
passages. We use the same segmentation code used in iKAT 2023
for segmenting the documents. The iKAT 2023 dataset included
a Pyserini [ 24] index for the collection. We extend the existing
collection from iKAT 2023 by publishing a newly learned sparse
retrieval index. This index uses CoCondenser SelfDistil SPLADE++
checkpoint from HuggingFace5, using a numba index, as in the
original SPLADE GitHub repository.
Passage relevance assessment. The relevance of the passages
is assessed using the same scale of scores (0–4) used for TREC
iKAT 2023 and CAsT collections. The NIST assessors judged the
relevance of passages. We selected a subset of 116 turns from 218
turns for relevance assessment by discarding the very general and
clarification turns. We tried to keep the turns with relevant PTKB
statements for relevance assessment.
5naver/splade-cocondenser-selfdistilAdaptive pooling. As the existing research [ 2] has shown reusabil-
ity issues for the TREC iKAT 2023 dataset, we tried to mitigate this
challenge by using an adaptive pooling approach rather than the
existing static pooling approach. The adaptive pooling enabled us
to assess up to the top 30 passages, leading to considerably more
relevant passages. To do so, we first leveraged automated GPT4o rel-
evance assessment. The existing research [ 2,17] shows that LLM s
tend to be more forgiving than human annotators (i.e., the average
relevance scores are higher) while exhibiting a relatively low false
negative rate. Based on these findings, we filtered out the passages
in the top 30 pool and asked the NIST assessors to only assess the
passages that were deemed relevant by GPT4o. To avoid reinforcing
GPT4 biases and the LLM evaluation circularity problem, included
all the top 5 passages in the final assessment pool. But for the pas-
sages ranked between the top 5 and top 30, we applied the LLM
filtering. In doing so, the size of the final assessment pool is 20,575
passages and is judged by the NIST assessors.
Gold response. After assessment of the passage’s relevance, We
asked the NIST assessors to write a comprehensive gold response for
the user utterances using the information from relevant passages.
The NIST assessors provided a gold response for 62 turns, selected
by the organizers based on their complexity. Each gold response is
written using a different number of relevant passages. An average
number of 21.6 passages are used for writing the gold responses. The
average length of the gold responses is approximately 104 words.
Nuggets of information. The nuggets of information are extracted
from relevant passages by NIST assessors. These nuggets serve as
a resource for the evaluation of the response generated by RAG
systems. Different from the existing approaches [ 31,37] that use
a phrasal expression for the information nuggets, the nugget ex-
tracted by NIST assessors is a continuous span of the passages. In
total, 2,279 nuggets of information are extracted from 79 turns. More
statistics about our collection of nuggets are provided in Table 2. As
these nuggets are extracted from different relevant passages, there
might be duplicates of information between them. For example,
however, the following two nuggets "Snake plants can survive with
infrequent watering" and "Snake plants (Sansevieria) are highly
drought-tolerant" are extracted from different passages, but they
carry the same information and are considered duplicates. We re-
move the duplicated nuggets and create a smaller set of nuggets.
After removing the duplicate nuggets, we have 1,201 nuggets. We
release both the original nuggets annotated by NIST assessors and
the de-duplicated version of them.
Nugget entailment labels. Our goal is to benchmark the nugget
entailment and matching. In particular, given a generated response,
and an extracted information nugget, the task is to assess if the
information nugget is entailed in the generated passage, i.e., is there
a match? See Section 5.2 for more details. We release a total of 1,356
nugget entailment labels, collected via crowdsourcing on Amazing
Mechanical Turk (MTurk). This resource will enable the researchers
to develop and evaluate the entailment models for nugget-based
RAG evaluation.

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Abbasiantaeb et al
PTKB statement relevance assessment. The relevance of each
PTKB statement to each conversational turn is assessed by the orga-
nizers during the topic development, as well as the NIST assessors.
The PTKB statements are classified as relevant or irrelevant. The or-
ganizers assessed the relevance of PTKB statements for all 218 turns
in the dataset. While the NIST assessors only judged the relevance
of PTKB statements on the subset of turns that are selected for
passage relevance assessment. We release both sets of assessments.
3.2 Automatic Resources
LLM -based relevance assessment pool. We create a pool of
32,999 query–passage pairs by selecting the top 30 passages re-
turned by participating runs. We use the GPT4o model and the
code released by [ 2] to assess the relevance of passages in the pool.
The pool has 17,130, 8,771, 4,393, 1,993, and 712 passages with
relevance scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We release this
automatically judge pool as a resource.
LLM -extracted passage nuggets. We use our nugget extraction
model described in Section 4.1 to extract the nuggets of information
from relevant passages in the assessment pool, i.e., repeating what
the NIST assessors did in extracting nuggets. Our model extracted
in total of 6,680 nuggets for 79 turns while the human annotators
extracted 2,279 nuggets from the same set of passages. For more
statistics on the nuggets by LLM see Table 2.
LLM -extracted response nuggets. After extracting the passage
nuggets in the previous step, we use the same model to extract
nuggets from generated responses (submitted by iKAT participants)
and release them as a resource. It includes the nuggets by LLM for
26 different responses over 79 conversational turns.
3.3 RAG Evaluation Pipeline.
We release the code for our RAG evaluation pipeline ( CONE-RAG )
as a resource. The researchers can use CONE-RAG to evaluate the
quality of the generated response. The released pipeline takes the
generated responses for each user utterance as input in a JSON file
and reports the following metrics:
(1)Total nugget precision and recall based on four different sets
of gold nuggets namely, human nuggets, de-duplicated human
nuggets, LLM nuggets, and de-duplicated LLM nuggets.
(2)Nugget precision and recall over different turns from the dataset.
(3)Rank of the submitted run compared to the baseline and partic-
ipants’ runs.
(4)List of nuggets extracted by the input submission, with a label
indicating whether it is matched with gold nuggets or not.
3.4 Participant Resources
As an additional resource, we provide several submission runs, to-
gether with baselines for a total of 41 runs from 8 teams (including
Organizer). The existing runs belong to three different categories in-
cluding automatic (28 runs), manual (10 runs), and generation-only
(3 runs). In the manual runs, the retrieval and response generation
models use both or one of the resolved_utterance and relevant
PTKB statements provided in the dataset. The generation-only runs
only provide the output of the response generation and use theTable 1: Statistics of Test Retrieval Data

Retrieval. For retrieval, most runs used a multi-step pipeline con-
sisting of the following: (1) PTKB statement relevance prediction; (2)
conversational rewriting (most incorporating the previous canoni-
cal responses as well as predicted relevance PTKB statements) and
conversational query expansion; (3) retrieval using traditional lex-
ical or neural IR models; and (4) multi-stage passage re-ranking
with neural language models.
Response generation. For generation, the runs mostly relied on a
RAG pipeline, using retrieved passages from the previous step with
the conversation history or rewrite. Then, a diverse set of LLMs
were used: Llama 8B and 70B, GPT4, GPT4o, and Gemini-1.5-flash.

4 RAG Evaluation Pipeline Overview
We propose CONE-RAG , a nugget-based evaluation pipeline for as-
sessment of the generated responses. The pipeline consists of two
components namely nugget extraction and matching. The nugget
extraction component extracts the nuggets of the information from
the input response. The matching component has two approaches
to match either the response or the nuggets of the response to the
gold nuggets to measure the nugget recall and precision.
4.1 Nuggets Extraction
We employ zero-shot prompting an LLM to generate the nuggets
of the information from the input text given the user question. The
generated nuggets must be spans of the input text. The prompt
we use for nugget extraction is shown in Table 3. The component
extracts a set of nuggets called N𝑃from the input text called 𝑡.
TheN𝑃is a set of spans from the input text 𝑡, where each span is
representative of one nugget and is shown as 𝑛𝑝. The input text ( 𝑡)
can be a response ( 𝑅) or a passage ( 𝑃). We use the resolved_utterance
(𝑞𝑟) as the user query in the prompt as it is the self-contained query
of the user containing both relevant statements from PTKB and the
context of the conversation. The nugget extraction function (called
𝑁𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑟 ) is shown in the following equation:
N𝑃=𝑁𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑟(𝑡,𝑞𝑟) (1)
4.2 Nugget Matching
We employ two approaches for matching the input response with
the gold nuggets: (1) by extracting nuggets from the input response
N𝑃and matching individual nuggets with gold nuggets N𝐺; and
(2) by matching the input response 𝑅directly to the gold nuggets
N𝐺, without extracting nuggets from the input response.
Nugget to Nugget (NtN) This approach assesses whether the ex-
tracted nugget entails a gold nugget or not. Given a set of extracted
nuggets N𝑃and a set of gold nuggets N𝐺, we compute entailment
scores between all nugget pairs using the following function:
𝑠=NtN(𝑛𝑝,𝑛𝑔) (2)
where𝑛𝑝and𝑛𝑞are a single extracted nugget and a single gold
nugget, respectively. 𝑠=1if the extracted nugget 𝑛𝑝entails the
gold nugget 𝑛𝑔, and 0 otherwise. The matching process consists
of iterating over all (𝑛𝑝,𝑛𝑔)pairs of extracted nuggets and gold
nuggets to determine coverage. We use a Natural Language Infer-
ence ( NLI) model to implement the NtN function. This allows us toTable 4: The prompt designed for NtR matching.
#Instruction: I will provide you with a response and a gold
information piece. Your task is to determine whether the response
captures this piece of information or not.
#Gold Information: {𝑛𝑔}
#Response: {𝑅}
#Please answer the following :
Does the Response capture the Gold Information? Only respond
with “yes” or “no” without further explanation.
#Answer (yes/no):
determine the subset of covered gold nuggets N′
𝐺⊆N𝐺, and the
subset of input response nuggets that covers them N′
𝑃⊆N𝑃. As a
result, we can compute both nugget recall and precision.
Nugget to Response (NtR) In this approach, we directly evaluate
whether the generated response entails a gold nugget. Instead of
comparing individual nuggets, the matching model is prompted
with a response 𝑅and a gold nugget 𝑛𝑔, and predicts a binary
outcome. This method enables an assessment of whether a response
sufficiently covers the gold nuggets without requiring extracting
nuggets of the system input response. We use the prompt shown in
Table 4 for matching the input response 𝑅with the gold nugget 𝑛𝑔.
Note that we prompt the LLM with each gold nugget individually
to break down the task into small units.
𝑠=NtR(𝑅,𝑛𝑔) (3)
We use zero-shot prompting on LLM to implement function NtR.
This allows us to determine the subset of covered gold nuggets
N′
𝐺⊆N𝐺as the set of gold nuggets for which 𝑠=1. Using this
approach we can only compute the nugget recall.
4.3 Nugget Duplicate Removal
To ensure a more concise and non-redundant set of nuggets for
evaluation, we perform de-duplication by removing gold nuggets (or
extracted nuggets) that can be entailed by another nugget within
the same set. This process is applied separately to both human-
annotated gold nuggets and LLM-generated gold nuggets. For a
given set of gold nuggets N𝐺, we filter out any nugget 𝑛𝑔∈N𝐺if
there exists another nugget 𝑛′𝑔∈N𝐺\{𝑛𝑔}such that𝐸(𝑛′𝑔,𝑛𝑔)=1.
𝐸(𝑛′𝑔,𝑛𝑔)indicates that 𝑛′𝑔entails𝑛𝑔. Any nugget that is fully cov-
ered by another is removed, ensuring that only the most informa-
tive and distinct nuggets remain. By eliminating redundant nuggets
within each source, this deduplication step refines the evaluation
set and prevents overestimation of recall.
5 Evaluation
In this section, we explain our evaluation method for three main
tasks of TREC iKAT 2024 including response generation, passage
retrieval, and PTKB statement classification.
5.1 Experimental Setup
Our framework uses different models in the nugget extraction
and nugget matching components. For the nuggets extraction,

we rely on GPT4o [ 26] as the base LLM that we prompt in zero-
shot. For the NtN matching part, we employ a NLIDeBERTa [ 19]
model, MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli . For
the NtR, we compare both using LLMs and NLI models, compar-
ing GPT4o and DeBERTa. Additionally, duplicate removal is also
made with the same NLI DeBERTa model. We rely on the BERGEN
GitHub for computing the surface base metrics.7
5.2 Proposed RAG Evaluation Pipeline
Nugget extraction. We assess the performance of this component
in two ways.
(1)First, we employ the nugget extraction model on the same set
of relevant passages that are used for extracting nuggets by
human. In this way, we create a new set of gold nuggets by
LLM. We compare the extracted nuggets by LLM with the gold
nuggets annotated by human.
(2)We apply the matching approaches using two different sources
of gold nuggets including (1) gold nuggets from humans and
(2) gold nuggets extracted by LLM (see Section 3). We rank the
participating runs based on their performance using each set of
gold nuggets. We compute the correlation between these two
rankings.
Nuggets matching. We run a human study to do the NtR matching
task on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We give a response with
a gold nugget to the human annotators and ask them to answer the
following question by selecting one of the “Yes" or “No" choices.
“Is the gold nugget of information covered in the response?” We
designed a comprehensive guideline for the task and to ensure the
quality of annotations 1) we put a test question in a random location
in the study and discarded the annotations of the users who gave
a wrong answer to the test question, 2) limited the annotators to
those who have more than 98% approval rate, have successfully
completed more than 5,000 Hits, and are from UK, US, or Australia.
We randomly selected 25 turns from the 79 turns with manual
nuggets and picked the best run for each participating team based
on the passage retrieval performance. In total, we had 1,356 pairs of
response–nugget pairs and divided them into batches 136 batches
where each batch includes 10 response–nugget pairs. We included
one additional test question in each batch of data and assigned

each batch to 3 different annotators. We select the choice with a
majority vote between 3 annotators as the final answer. We call the
set of nuggets from gold nuggets matched by the input response
by human N′
𝑃[𝐻]. We compute the agreement between human
assessors and our NtR model by comparing N′
𝑃andN′
𝑃[𝐻].
End-to-end matching. We evaluate the end-to-end performance
of our proposed model in the case of using the NtR matching model.
We use the set of N′
𝑃andN′
𝑃[𝐻]to evaluate the participating
runs8. We rank the runs using each output and compute the rank
correlation.
5.3 Response Generation
To evaluate the quality of the generated responses by participating
teams, we use two different evaluation paradigms including (1)
surface-based metrics and (2) our proposed nugget-based RAG
evaluation pipeline.
Reference-based evaluation. We employ surface-based, semantic-
based, and LLM-based metrics and compare our gold response as
a reference with the input response. We report the metrics such
as Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-L, BEM [ 11], and LLMEval with both
GPT-4o [ 20] and SOLAR-10.7B-Instructv1.0 [ 22]. In addition, we
report the groundedness metric [ 5] which measures to what extent
the input response is grounded to the top passages by the passage
retrieval model.
Nugget-based RAG evaluation pipeline. We employ our pro-
posed RAG evaluation framework and get the set of gold nuggets
covered by the generated response. We will explain in the follow-
ing how can we calculate the recall and precision of two different
approaches for matching.
•Nugget to Nugget. We compute the nugget recall and precision
in this approach using the following equations.
Recall NtN=|N′
𝐺|
|N𝐺|=|{𝑛𝑔∈N𝐺|∃𝑛𝑝∈N𝑃,NtN(𝑛𝑝,𝑛𝑔)=1}|
|N𝐺|
(4)
Precision NtN=|N′
𝑃|
|N𝑃|=|{𝑛𝑝∈N𝑃|∃𝑛𝑔∈N𝐺,NtN(𝑛𝑝,𝑛𝑔)=1}|
|N𝑃|
(5)
The former, Recall NtN, measures the proportion of gold nuggets
that are entailed by at least one extracted nugget. The latter,
Precision NtN, measures the proportion of extracted nuggets that
entail at least one gold nugget.
•Nugget to response. We define the nugget recall in this approach
as follows.
Recall NtR=|N′′
𝐺|
|N𝐺|=|{𝑛𝑔∈N𝐺|NtR(𝑅,𝑛𝑔)=1}|
|N𝐺|(6)
8Note that the gold nugget by human is used for the NtR

This metric evaluates recall by considering whether the full re-
sponse directly supports the gold nuggets, independent of explicit
nugget extraction.
5.4 Passage Ranking
We assess the submitted runs using different cutt_offs over metrics
like precision, recall, and nDCG. The primary evaluation metric is
mean nDCG@5. We compute the average over all conversational
turns with the same weight.
6 Results & Analysis
6.1 RAG evaluation: Comparison with human
performance
LLM-based nugget extraction. Human extracted 2,279 nuggets
while our LLM-based model extracted 6,680 nuggets. The aver-
age length of the nuggets by humans is around 32 words while
for nuggets by LLM is around 14 words. The LLM-based nugge-
tizer model tends to extract more fine-grained and specific nuggets.
Among the 6,680 nuggets extracted by LLM, 144 of them exactly
match and 4,189 of them partially match with human nuggets while
2491 of them are new nuggets. Among the nuggets that partially
match 2,443 of them have overlap over at least two words, 1,746
of them overlap over one or two words, and 2,159 of them overlap
over more than 4 words with the human nuggets.
Rank correlation using LLM and human nuggets. We evalu-
ate the participating systems using CONE-RAG and rank them. We
repeat this process using a different set of gold nuggets. In Table
5 we report the correlation between the ranking of participating
systems using different sets of gold nuggets. As can be seen, with-
out removing the duplicate nuggets, the correlation between the
ranking of systems based on nugget recall is 0.731 and 0.889 using
Kendall’s𝜏and Spearman’s 𝜌metrics, respectively.
LLM vs. human for NtR matching. We compute the agreement
between humans and our NtR model in Table 6. The GPT4o model
performs better than DeBERTa on the NtR matching task by achiev-
ing Cohen’s 𝜅agreement of 0.61 and an Accuracy of 0.9.
Human vs. LLM for Recall NtR. We use our end-to-end frame-
work ( CONE-RAG ) to calculate the Recall NtRfor the runs and sort
them. Also, we use the human for NtR matching and calculating
the Recall NtR. The CONE-RAG (based on GPT4o) achieves a rank
correlation of 0.867 and 0.943 compared to humans on Kendall’s 𝜏
and Spearman’s 𝜌rank correlation metrics. Using DeBERTa for NtR
matching, Kendall’s 𝜏and Spearman’s 𝜌rank correlation metrics
are 0.6 and 0.829.

NtN vs. NtR matching. The correlation between the ranking of
systems using each method of matching in CONE-RAG is shown in
Table 7. As can be seen, we achieve Kendall’s 𝜏and Spearman’s 𝜌
rank correlation of 0.778 and 0.923 when we use these matching
models and sort the systems. Also, using the original set of gold
nuggets by either LLM or humans, the correlation is approximately
equal. This observation shows the robustness of matching models
against the input set of gold nuggets.
Nugget-based evaluation vs reference-based evaluation. We
report the rank correlation between the ranking of systems using
CONE-RAG and reference-based metrics in Table 8. Surprisingly, we
observe a very low correlation with the ROUGE, although this
metric is also recall-oriented, using n-gram of predicted and hu-
man reference response. This fact highlights the stark contrast in
performance between these two evaluation paradigms where each
method focuses on distinctly different aspects. The reference-based
metrics like Rouge only consider the semantic similarity, however,
the nugget-based evaluation works by comparing the nuggets of
the information in the content of the response. Interestingly, the
correlation between nugget recall and precision with grounded-
ness is negative. A response can have a high nugget recall while
the nuggets of information in the response are from the intrinsic
knowledge of the response generation model and not from the
input passages. The CONE-RAG has a higher rank correlation with
LLMEval and BEM metrics.
Original nuggets vs. de-duplicated nuggets. The correlation
between the ranking of systems using original gold nuggets and
after removing duplicate nuggets is shown in Table 5. Removing the
duplicate nuggets results in a higher decrease in correlation in over
precision than recall. For example, after removing the duplicates
from the original human gold nuggets, Kendall’s Tau correlation is
0.591 and 0.848 over precision, and recall, respectively.
Comparison between response generation performance of
participating teams. We report the performance of participating
teams in Table 9. Using the NtR matching model, the value of
recall is much higher compared to the NtN matching model. This
observation represents that the NtR matching model matches the
response to a higher number of gold nuggets while the NtN model
matches the lower number of extracted nuggets from the response
to the gold nuggets. Using the LLM or human nuggets as gold
nuggets, we observe a lower difference in the value of recall over

different teams. However, the difference in the values of precision
for each team is a bit higher compared to recall. This is in line
with the rank correlation in Table 5 where the rank correlation
when using LLM or human gold nuggets is higher over the recall
metric than the precision metric. Interestingly, the runs with higher
nugget recall and precision have a lower groundedness value while
teams with lower nugget recall and precision have a higher value of
groundedness. For example, the “iires-1” team has a nugget recall
value of 0.018 while it has a groundedness of 0.855. While the “uva-3”
team has a nugget recall of 0.138 with a groundedness of 0.387.Performance per personal turns. We classify the turns as per-
sonal and non-personal where the turns with at least one relevant
PTKB statement are considered as personal turns. Looking at Ta-
ble 10, we observe that nugget precision and recall over personal
turns is generally lower compared to non-personal turns.
6.2 Retrieval performance evaluation

and manual runs in Table 11. We do not observe a very large gap be-
tween the performance of manual and automatic runs which shows

Correlation between passage retrieval and response genera-
tion performance. As can be seen in Table 12, the correlation be-
tween response generation and passage retrieval is higher when us-
ing gold nuggets from LLM compared to using nuggets by humans.
In addition, by removing duplicates from human gold nuggets, the
correlation increases over both nugget precision and nugget recall
metrics. However, removing duplicates from LLM gold nugget, the
correlation increases only in terms the nugget recall metric. We
do not observe a high correlation between nugget recall/precision
and ndcg@5. Based on this observation, we cannot say that better
performance in passage retrieval guarantees a higher nugget re-
call/precision on response generation. This gap between retrieval
performance and response generation performance can be due to
multiple reasons such as the focus of retrieval models on one as-
pect or the usage of intrinsic knowledge of response generation
models. However, further in-depth analysis is required to deter-
mine the main reason. We show the nugget recall of the automatic
runs (based on the NtN matching approach) vs the nDCG@5 in
Figure 1. The “uva-X“ runs have the highest retrieval performance
and nugget recall. These runs are based on the MQ4CS model [ 1]
which breaks the information need of the user into multi-aspect
queries. This observation indicates the effectiveness of leveraging
multi-aspect queries for generating a more complete answer that
covers a more diverse set of information. In addition, these runs
used the GPT-4 model for response generation.
7 Conclusion
We introduce the iKAT 2024 collection and resources, building
on the foundations established by TREC iKAT 2024. These re-
sources empower researchers to evaluate personalized conversa-
tional search agents (CSA) across both passage retrieval and re-
sponse generation tasks. A key innovation of our work is CONE-RAG ,
a nugget-based evaluation pipeline for retrieval-augmented gener-
ation (RAG), along with an assessment pool for passage retrieval.
TheCONE-RAG enables the assessment of generated responses using
nugget recall and precision metrics. Extensive experiments com-
pare the framework’s effectiveness against human performance,
demonstrating its robustness and reliability. We also provide the
gold nuggets and matching of nuggets with responses which can be
used for the development of nugget extraction and nugget matching
models. In addition, we propose the gold responses for each con-
versational turn as a resource which is essential for surface-based
evaluation.
