## Abstract
Geographic Question Answering (GeoQA) addresses natural language queries in
geographic domains to fulfill complex user demands and improve information
retrieval efficiency. Traditional QA systems, however, suffer from limited
comprehension, low retrieval accuracy, weak interactivity, and inadequate
handling of complex tasks, hindering precise information acquisition. This
study presents GeoRAG, a knowledge-enhanced QA framework integrating
domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) technology to enhance geographic knowledge retrieval accuracy
and user interaction. The methodology involves four components: (1) A
structured geographic knowledge base constructed from 3267 corpora (research
papers, monographs, and technical reports), categorized via a multi-agent
approach into seven dimensions: semantic understanding, spatial location,
geometric morphology, attribute characteristics, feature relationships,
evolutionary processes, and operational mechanisms. This yielded 145234
classified entries and 875432 multi-dimensional QA pairs. (2) A multi-label
text classifier based on BERT-Base-Chinese, trained to analyze query types
through geographic dimension classification. (3) A retrieval evaluator
leveraging QA pair data to assess query-document relevance, optimizing
retrieval precision. (4) GeoPrompt templates engineered to dynamically
integrate user queries with retrieved information, enhancing response quality
through dimension-specific prompting. Comparative experiments demonstrate
GeoRAG's superior performance over conventional RAG across multiple base
models, validating its generalizability. This work advances geographic AI by
proposing a novel paradigm for deploying large language models in
domain-specific contexts, with implications for improving GeoQA systems
scalability and accuracy in real-world applications.

Abstract
Geographic Question Answering (GeoQA) refers to methodologies that retrieve or generate
answers to users’ natural language queries in geographical domains, effectively addressing complex
and diverse user demands while enhancing information retrieval efficiency. However, traditional
QA approaches exhibit limitations including poor comprehension, low retrieval efficiency, weak in-
teractivity, and inability to handle complex tasks, thereby failing to meet users’ needs for accurate
information acquisition. This paper proposes GeoRAG, a knowledge-enhanced QA method aligned
with geographical domain perspectives, which integrates domain fine-tuning and prompt engineer-
ing into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to improve geographical knowledge
retrieval precision and optimize user interaction experience. The methodology comprises four key
components. First, we collected 3,267 pieces of corpus materials including geographical research
papers, monographs, and technical reports, then employed a multi-agent approach to categorize
the corpus into seven geographical dimensions: semantic understanding, spatial location, geo-
metric morphology, attribute characteristics, feature relationships, evolutionary processes, and
operational mechanisms. This process established a structured knowledge base containing 145,234
classified data entries and 875,432 multi-dimensional QA pairs. Second, we developed a multi-label
text classifier based on the Bert-Base-Chinese model, trained with classification data to determine
query types through geographical dimension analysis, and constructed a retrieval evaluator using
QA pair data to assess query-document relevance for enhanced retrieval accuracy. Subsequently, we
designed GeoPrompt templates through prompt engineering to integrate user queries with retrieved
information based on dimensional characteristics, further improving response quality. Comparative
experiments between GeoRAG and conventional RAG implementations across different base mod-
els demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of our method. Furthermore, this
study proposes a novel application paradigm for large language models in geographical domains,
potentially advancing the development of GeoAI technologies.
1 Introduction
Geographic Question Answering (GeoQA) plays a vital role in education, research, and public pol-
icy formulation by providing precise geographical information. Early approaches relied on rule-based
systems or keyword-matching search engines, which exhibited limited capability in handling com-
plex queries. With advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), these models have become mainstream solutions for
geographic QA systems. However, due to the inherent characteristics of geographical systems – in-
cluding spatiotemporal complexity, intricate interactions among components, and multifaceted driving
mechanisms [LZL+21] – coupled with LLMs’ limitations in accessing up-to-date information [Kom21],
performing precise mathematical computations [PBG21], and temporal reasoning [DCE+22], existing
methods struggle to meet the demands of sophisticated geographic QA tasks. This necessitates the
integration of retrieval-augmented techniques to consolidate knowledge and enhance answer accuracy.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs’ generative capabilities by incorporating
relevant text passages retrieved from external knowledge bases [GLT+20]. In general-purpose LLM
applications, RAG has demonstrated effectiveness in updating and enriching model knowledge while ad-
dressing static knowledge and information latency issues. However, its performance critically depends
on the relevance and accuracy of retrieved knowledge [ZLC+23, YGZL24]. For vertical domains like

geography, conventional retrieval methods often fail to accurately capture semantic meanings of spe-
cialized terminology and geographic nomenclature. Current RAG implementations in domain-specific
applications primarily manifest in three forms:
(1) Rule-based QA Systems: These systems employ predefined rules and templates to parse natural
language questions into structured queries. The first GeoQA system proposed by Zelle and Mooney uti-
lized the CHILL parser to answer natural language geographic questions based on Geoquery language.
Chen et al. [CFLX+13] developed a geographic QA framework leveraging spatial operators supported
by PostGIS to address five question types involving location, orientation, and distance. While effective,
such approaches handle only limited question types due to the impracticality of exhaustively encoding
all potential queries.
(2) Knowledge Graph-based QA Systems: These methods construct knowledge graphs to com-
prehend relationships between geographic entities. Hao et al. [HZL+17] translated natural language
queries into structured SPARQL queries to retrieve entities and predicates from geographic knowl-
edge graphs. Punjani et al. [PSB+18] proposed a template-based GeoQA system extracting answers
for seven factual question types from geographic knowledge graphs. Nevertheless, such template-
dependent approaches lack flexibility in handling diverse user queries.
(3) LLM-based QA Systems: These leverage machine learning capabilities, particularly LLMs, to
generate natural and multidimensional answers. Hu et al. [HMC+23] integrated geographic knowledge
about location descriptions with Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) to extract geospatial
information from disaster-related social media messages. Bhandari et al. [BAP23] demonstrated
LLMs’ potential in encoding geographic knowledge through evaluations of geospatial awareness and
reasoning capabilities. While LLMs can retrieve basic information like city coordinates [BAP23], they
face significant challenges in handling complex geographic QA tasks, particularly regarding retrieval
text quality.
The multidimensional nature, extensive conceptual scope, and substantial subjective influences
inherent in geographic knowledge render existing RAG approaches inadequate. This study proposes
GeoRAG, integrating domain fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and RAG techniques from the tripar-
tite geographical research perspective (physical, human, and technical worlds) to enhance GeoQA
performance. Specifically, our method classifies question types based on geographic element charac-
teristics, employs differentiated retrieval strategies, and implements a lightweight retrieval evaluator
to assess relevance and accuracy of retrieved documents. This systematic approach filters high-quality
information to improve answer precision. Ultimately, GeoRAG establishes an end-to-end QA sys-
tem capable of efficiently handling diverse geographic problems, offering novel solutions for complex
knowledge-intensive geographic inquiries.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces geographic question classification and the
GeoRAG framework. Section 3 details retrieval modes, reasoning methods, and implementations for
different question types. Section 4 describes dataset construction methodologies and generated dataset
characteristics. Section 5 presents experimental comparisons validating GeoRAG’s performance in
geographic QA tasks. Finally, Section 6 concludes with research contributions and future directions.
2 GeoRAG
2.1 Question Taxonomy
Geography studies the spatial patterns, evolutionary processes, and human-environment interactions
within Earth’s surface systems [CFX+19], encompassing three conceptual domains: the physical world
(natural environments and material systems), the human world (social behaviors and activities), and
the information world (integration of natural and human data). The International Geographical Union
(IGU) categorizes geographical inquiries into six fundamental questions: ”Where is it?”, ”When did
it occur?”, ”What is its form?”, ”Why is it there?”, ”What impacts does it produce?”, and ”How
can it benefit humanity and nature?” [CGE92]. Geographic questions strictly adhere to geographical
principles, with interacting entities forming intricate relationships. Simple questions permit context-
independent objective answers, while composite questions involving spatiotemporal interactions of
multiple entities require geographical reasoning. Formal definitions are provided in Definitions 2.3 and
2.5.
2

definition 2.1. A simple geographical question Qsimple (n+ 1, XD ) =f(g(n))queries directly observ-
able entity attributes through equivalence relations C≡D, where TD={C1=D1, C2=D2,···, Cn=
Dn}directly characterizes geographic entities through element definitions. Here Ci∈Tdenotes element
classes and Ditheir defining formulas.
definition 2.2. A composite geographical question addresses entity evolution and interaction mecha-
nisms through functional composition f◦g(x), where xdenotes geographic entities, g(x)their attributes,
andf(y)interaction relationships. The knowledge base K={f1◦g1(x), . . . , f n◦gn(x)}systematically
organizes these composite definitions.
definition 2.3. Geographical knowledge is formalized as a quintuple O=⟨G, T, TD, X, XD ⟩where G
represents geographic entity set, T=⟨S, P, F, A, R ⟩captures primitive elements (semantics, position,
form, attributes, relations), TDdefines primitive elements through equivalence relations, X=⟨E, M⟩
models composite elements (evolution processes, mechanisms), and XD specifies composite elements
through functional compositions.
definition 2.4. Primitive element definitions establish equivalence relations C≡Dbetween element
classes Ci∈Tand their formal descriptions Di, constructing the definition set TDthrough systematic
characterization of geographic entities.
definition 2.5. Composite element definitions model entity dynamics through nested functions f◦
g(x), where g(x)extracts entity attributes and f(y)establishes interaction patterns, assembling these
evolutionary mechanisms into the knowledge base K.
definition 2.6. Geographic corpus is structured as a ternary tree IS=⟨O, R, D ⟩where O=⟨T, TD ⟩
constitutes knowledge components, Rencodes hierarchical relations (parent U(t), child L(t), equivalent
E(t)classes), and Dorganizes theme-specific document sets d(ti)for elements ti∈T.
Conventional vector-space retrieval methods using cosine similarity often fail in geographical con-
texts due to inadequate domain constraints. While simple questions can be answered through direct
pattern matching (Definition 2.1), composite questions require multistage reasoning (Equation 1).
We design differentiated retrieval strategies to mitigate factual errors caused by irrelevant retrievals
[ZLC+23, YGZL24].
definition 2.7. Geographical questions are categorized as:
•Simple questions Qsimple (n, TD ): Retrieve equivalent knowledge Q1(t) =∪{d(t′)|t′∈E(t)}
through five retrieval modes (direct/indirect parent/child class retrieval)
•Composite questions Qcomposite (n, XD ): Require iterative reasoning formalized as:
Qcomposite (n+ 1, XD ) =f(g(n)) (1)
combining retrieval with evaluative inference
2.2 Framework
GeoRAG enhances geographic question answering through a three-phase architecture (Fig. ??):
Phase 1: Knowledge Retrieval combines corpus construction and semantic search. The domain-
specific knowledge base employs spatial-semantic chunking strategies with multilingual embedding
optimization. Query processing utilizes isomorphic embedding architectures enhanced by geographic
constraint algorithms.
Phase 2: Relevance Reassessment implements hierarchical evaluation: (a) A seven-dimensional
classifier (trained on 875k QA pairs) categorizes queries using geographic taxonomy (semantics, lo-
cation, morphology, attributes, relationships, evolution, mechanisms); (b) Dimension-specific BERT
evaluators reassess document relevance through multi-agent debate mechanisms, with training data
refined via LLM-powered synthetic generation.
Phase 3: Knowledge-Augmented Generation employs structured GeoPrompt templates that:
•Organize documents using geographic dimension tags
3

•Inject domain reasoning patterns through:
Pgeo=7[
i=1[Di⊕Ti(Q)] (2)
where Didenotes dimension-tagged documents and Tirepresents dimension-specific instructions
The operational pipeline comprises: (a) Initial geographic retrieval, (b) Dimensional filtering with
score aggregation, (c) Structured prompting for LLM reasoning. Evaluations demonstrate 23.7% ac-
curacy improvement over baseline RAG implementations.
3 Retrieval Strategies and Model Inference Methods
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge sources, improving performance in language modeling and open-domain QA tasks
[GLT+20, ILL+22]. This paradigm retrieves contextual information through a dedicated module and
integrates it into LLM generation processes. While RAG demonstrates significant advantages across
applications, its effectiveness critically depends on the relevance and accuracy of retrieved documents
[AWW+23]. High-quality retrievals directly influence generation outcomes, making retrieval optimiza-
tion crucial for performance improvement.
However, conventional RAG approaches face challenges in geographic QA scenarios. First, exist-
ing methods inadequately address domain-specific terminology and geographic nomenclature prevalent
in geographical texts. Standard embedding models trained on general corpora often fail to capture
semantic nuances of specialized vocabulary, degrading similarity computation accuracy. Second, tradi-
tional cosine similarity-based retrieval ignores the seven-dimensional geographic knowledge framework
(semantics, location, morphology, attributes, relationships, evolution, and mechanisms), resulting in
semantically irrelevant retrievals despite high vector similarity. These limitations substantially reduce
retrieval quality and subsequent answer accuracy.
To address these issues, we propose a three-phase retrieval strategy aligned with geographic knowl-
edge representation:
•Classification : A multi-label classifier trained on annotated datasets automatically categorizes
user queries into geographic dimensions
•Dimension-Aware Retrieval : Implements differentiated retrieval modes (iterative/recursive)
based on query categories
•Relevance Evaluation : Fine-tuned evaluators assess document-query relevance from seven
geographic perspectives
Figure ??illustrates the implementation workflow. The classification phase employs our seven-
dimensional taxonomy to guide subsequent operations. For retrieval, iterative methods expand query
context through multiple search cycles, while recursive approaches decompose complex queries into
sub-queries. The evaluation phase combines dimension-specific relevance scores using:
Sfinal =7X
i=1wi·Si(D, Q) (3)
where widenotes dimension weights and Sirepresents evaluator scores. This hierarchical process
ensures geographic salience in retrieved documents, enabling LLMs to generate accurate, domain-
grounded responses.
3.1 Question Classification
As established in Section 2.1, geographic questions require differentiated retrieval strategies based on
their knowledge dimensions. We implement a seven-dimensional classification framework encompass-
ing geographic semantics, spatial location, geometric morphology, attribute characteristics, element
relationships, evolutionary processes, and operational mechanisms. Following Definition 2.7, questions
are categorized as:
4

•Simple Questions : Addressing semantics, location, morphology, attributes, or relationships -
answerable through direct knowledge base retrieval
•Composite Questions : Involving evolutionary processes or mechanisms - requiring multi-step
reasoning over retrieved documents
Conventional single-label classification proves inadequate for geographic knowledge due to inherent
multidimensionality and inter-dimensional dependencies. Our solution employs multi-label classifi-
cation to establish one-to-many mappings between questions and geographic dimensions, enabling
comprehensive analysis of complex spatial relationships.
3.1.1 Seven-Dimensional Classifier Architecture
The classifier architecture features:
•Input: Question text encoded through geographic-aware embeddings
•Hidden Layers: 3 Transformer blocks with geographic attention mechanisms
•Output: Sigmoid-activated multi-label classification layer
The training configuration uses:
•Optimizer: AdamW with geographic gradient clipping
•Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy with dimension-aware weighting:
L=−7X
i=1αi[yilog(pi) + (1 −yi) log(1 −pi)] (4)
where αirepresents dimension-specific weights
The classification probability for each dimension is computed through:
p(xi) =1
1 +e−(wT
ih+bi)(5)
where:
•h: Final hidden state vector (768-dim)
•wi: Dimension-specific weight vector
•bi: Dimension-specific bias term
Threshold-based dimension assignment follows:
yi=(
1 if p(xi)≥τi
0 otherwise(6)
with dimension-specific thresholds τioptimized through grid search. This architecture achieves 0.89
macro F1-score on our geographic QA benchmark, significantly outperforming baseline single-label
approaches (0.72 F1-score).
3.2 Retrieval Strategy
As defined in 2.7, geographic questions can be categorized into simple and composite types. Simple
questions addressing primitive elements (Definition 2.4) employ cosine similarity retrieval:
Similarity( A, B) =A·B
∥A∥ × ∥ B∥=Pn
i=1(Ai×Bi)pPn
i=1A2
i×pPn
i=1B2
i(7)
Composite questions requiring evolutionary analysis (Definition 2.5) utilize an iterative retrieval
mechanism with multi-agent collaboration, as illustrated in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1.

3.2.1 Seven-Dimensional Scoring Architecture
The evaluator model employs BERT-Base-Chinese with enhanced geographic attention:
Ei=Wemb(xi) +Pi+Si (8)
where Wembdenotes the embedding matrix, Pipositional embeddings, and Sisegment embeddings
distinguishing question-document pairs.
The Transformer encoder outputs H= [h1, ..., h n] are processed through:
z=Wgh[CLS]+bg (9)
si= tanh( zi) =ezi−e−zi
ezi+e−zi(10)
where Wg∈R7×768generates dimension-specific scores. The architecture prioritizes geographic
features through:
•Dual-input structure separating question and document
•Attention bias toward geographic terminology
•Dimension-specific gradient weighting during training
This configuration achieves 0.92 correlation with human expert assessments on our geographic
relevance benchmark, outperforming standard BERT baselines by 18.7
3.3 Generation Methodology
The GeoRAG framework enhances LLM performance through dual mechanisms of structured prompt-
ing (GeoPrompt) and knowledge augmentation. Unlike conventional QA approaches relying solely
on pretrained models or fine-tuning, our method integrates domain-specific knowledge retrieval with
guided generation constraints.
definition 3.1. The GeoPrompt template is formally defined as:
GeoPrompt =⟨QuestionType ,DomainContext ,
UserQuery ,KnowledgeText ⟩
(1)Question Typology : Determined through seven-dimensional classification (geographic seman-
tics, spatial location, geometric morphology, attribute characteristics, element relationships, evo-
lutionary processes, and operational mechanisms). Guides evaluator selection and retrieval pri-
oritization.
(2)Domain Context : Optional user-provided specifications including:
–Academic discipline (e.g., physical geography)
–Research focus (e.g., fluvial geomorphology)
–Key aspects of interest (e.g., temporal scale constraints)
(3)User Query : Natural language question formulation.
(4)Knowledge Text : Expert-curated passages from geographic literature, filtered through our
seven-dimensional relevance evaluators. Sources include:
–Peer-reviewed journals (85% of corpus)
–Academic monographs (12%)
–Government reports (3%)

GeoPrompt Instantiation Example
”Act as a {discipline }expert specializing in {subfield }. Analyze the following {question
type}question using the provided evidence. Refrain from answering when uncertain.
Evidence :{KnowledgeText }
Question :{UserQuery }”
The generation process combines these elements through the structured template shown in Table
1. Our experiments demonstrate that GeoPrompt improves answer accuracy by 31.2% compared to
baseline prompts in geographic QA tasks.
Key implementation details:
•Dynamic slot filling based on classifier outputs
•Context-aware temperature scaling (0.2-0.7 range)
•Hallucination suppression through evidence grounding
This methodology achieves 0.88 factual consistency score on our geographic benchmark, outper-
forming standard RAG approaches by 27 percentage points.
4 Dataset Construction
4.1 Training Dataset Development
To construct high-quality training data for geographic relevance evaluators, we implement a multi-
agent system (MAS) leveraging MetaGPT [HZC+23] for automated dataset generation. Our framework
encodes Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) through coordinated agent workflows, as illustrated in
Figure 2.
The automated generation process comprises two phases:
4.1.1 Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation
Six specialized agents collaborate through these steps:
1.Fact Extraction Agent : Identifies knowledge-intensive text segments
2.Entity Extraction Agent : Extracts geographic entities using CRF-based tagging
3.Relation Extraction Agent : Detects inter-entity relationships as triples ( h, r, t )
4.Question Generation Agent : Creates questions from extracted triples
5.Quality Control Agent : Validates question-answer pairs
6.Typology Agent : Assigns seven-dimensional classifications
Figure 3 demonstrates the workflow, achieving 92.3% precision in triple extraction through agent
cross-validation.
4.1.2 Machine Reading Comprehension
This phase implements:
•Triple-to-dimension mapping using our seven-dimensional taxonomy
•Question-context pairing with binary relevance labels (1=relevant, 0=irrelevant)
•Dataset balancing through adversarial negative sampling
The final training corpus contains 146,570 annotated instances across seven dimensions, with inter-
annotator agreement k=0.87.

5.6.2 Precision-Recall Analysis
Figure 6 demonstrates GeoRAG’s balanced performance on Qwen2-7B, achieving harmonic mean im-
provements of:
•35.6% higher F1-score than base model
•22.8% better than standard RAG
The experimental results validate three key advantages:
1.Dimensional Specialization : 7.9-15.2% better performance on mechanism-related questions
2.Scale Robustness : Consistent gains across model sizes (7B-72B parameters)
3.Compositionality : 38% improvement on multi-hop reasoning tasks

6 Conclusion and Future Directions
This work presents GeoRAG, a seven-dimensional taxonomy-enhanced framework that demonstrates:
•28.7% accuracy improvement over vanilla RAG in geomorphological QA
•41.9% error reduction in factual hallucinations
•Robust cross-model applicability (tested on 8 LLM architectures)
While GeoRAG shows promising compatibility with various retrieval paradigms, its current imple-
mentation requires dimension-specific fine-tuning. Future research will explore:
•Unified multi-dimensional evaluator architectures
•Self-supervised adaptation mechanisms
•Cross-domain generalization to broader geographical subfields
The framework establishes a foundation for domain-specific RAG optimization, particularly valu-
able for Earth science applications requiring precise factual grounding and complex spatial reasoning.
