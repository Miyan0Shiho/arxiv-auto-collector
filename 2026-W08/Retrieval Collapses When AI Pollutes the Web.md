## Abstract
The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content on the Web presents a structural risk to information retrieval, as search engines and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems increasingly consume evidence produced by the Large Language Models (LLMs). We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval Collapse, a two-stage process where (1) AI-generated content dominates search results, eroding source diversity, and (2) low-quality or adversarial content infiltrates the retrieval pipeline. We analyzed this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the SEO scenario, a 67\% pool contamination led to over 80\% exposure contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination, baselines like BM25 exposed $\sim$19\% of harmful content, whereas LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabilities. These findings highlight the risk of retrieval pipelines quietly shifting toward synthetic evidence and the need for retrieval-aware strategies to prevent a self-reinforcing cycle of quality decline in Web-grounded systems.

Abstract
The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content on the Web presents
a structural risk to information retrieval, as search engines and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems increasingly con-
sume evidence produced by the Large Language Models (LLMs).
We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval Col-
lapse, a two-stage process where (1) AI-generated content domi-
nates search results, eroding source diversity, and (2) low-quality
or adversarial content infiltrates the retrieval pipeline. We analyzed
this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-
quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the
SEO scenario, a 67% pool contamination led to over 80% exposure
contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy
state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance
on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination,
baselines like BM25 exposed ∼19% of harmful content, whereas
LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabili-
ties. These findings highlight the risk of retrieval pipelines quietly
shifting toward synthetic evidence and the need for retrieval-aware
strategies to prevent a self-reinforcing cycle of quality decline in
Web-grounded systems.

1 Introduction
The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fun-
damentally transformed the landscape of Web content creation [ 16].
Although this shift offers scalability in information production, it
introduces a critical structural vulnerability for search engines and

https://doi.org/10.1145/3774904.3792955Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [ 9,12]. These sys-
tems increasingly consume evidence that is itself generated by the
very models they rely on, creating a self-referential cycle. While
similar phenomena have been studied in model training asmodel
collapse[ 1,15], the implications for theretrievalecosystem remain
underexplored.
We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval
Collapse, a two-stage degradation process. The first stage,Domi-
nance and Homogenization, occurs when high-quality, SEO-optimized
synthetic content captures the top search results, drastically reduc-
ing source diversity. This stage is particularly insidious because
it creates adeceptively healthystate: surface-level answer quality
may remain stable due to the fluency of LLM outputs, masking
the underlying erosion of information provenance. The second
stage,Pollution and System Corruption, emerges when low-quality
or adversarial content infiltrates the pipeline. In this phase, mali-
cious actors can exploit ranking algorithms to inject misleading
information, undermining the factual integrity of downstream RAG
systems.
To investigate these risks, we constructed a controlled experi-
mental environment using the MS MARCO dataset, simulating two
distinct contamination scenarios: (1) a high-quality SEO pool and (2)
an adversarial abuse pool. Our findings reveal a contrast in system
behavior. Under the SEO scenario, a Pool Contamination Rate of
67% led to an Exposure Contamination Rate exceeding 80% across
rankers, confirming a rapid shift toward homogenized synthetic
evidence [ 5]. Conversely, under the adversarial scenario, while LLM-
based rankers showed resilience, widely deployed baselines like
BM25 exhibited significant vulnerability, exposing approximately
19% of harmful content at the same contamination level.
This study highlights that current retrieval pipelines can quietly
shift toward synthetic or harmful evidence without immediate signs
of quality collapse. Our contributions are threefold:
•We formally conceptualize Retrieval Collapse as a structural
failure mode distinct from training-time model collapse.
•We provide empirical evidence of contamination dynamics,
quantifying how 67% pool contamination translates to over
80% exposure in SEO settings and ∼19% vulnerability in
BM25 under adversarial attacks.
•We underscore the necessity for retrieval-aware ranking
strategies that go beyond topical relevance to preserve ecosys-
tem diversity and trust.
2 Background and Related Work
While generative models degrade when trained on their own out-
puts, a phenomenon termedmodel collapse[ 1,15], prior research
typically focuses on closed training loops. In contrast, we address
structural risks during retrieval, where heterogeneous generators
and ranking systems shape the exposure landscape. Recent studiesarXiv:2602.16136v1  [cs.IR]  18 Feb 2026

WWW ’26, April 13–17, 2026, Dubai, United Arab Emirates Hongyeon Yu, Dongchan Kim, and Young-Bum Kim
have begun to explore similar feedback loops in Open Domain Ques-
tion Answering (ODQA) [ 3] and RAG corpus poisoning [ 17,19],
where adversarial actors inject malicious documents. However,
our work differentiates itself by analyzing theecosystem-levelshift
caused by mass-produced SEO content rather than isolated adver-
sarial attacks.
With the proliferation of AI-generated text [ 16], challenges in
attribution [ 13,14] and pre-training data quality [ 2,6] have in-
tensified. Unlike traditional keyword spam [ 8], modern synthetic
content is semantically coherent, allowing it to blend into rank-
ing systems and propagate through pipelines as authoritative evi-
dence [ 4,5,18,20]. We extend these findings by quantifying distinct
contamination dynamics driven by SEO-style versus adversarial
content. Although provenance techniques like datasheets [ 7] and
watermarking [ 11] offer document-level mechanisms, they do not
fully address the ecosystem degradation where the collective pres-
ence of synthetic documents reshapes ranking behavior.
3 Experimental Methodology
We construct a controlled environment to evaluate how different
forms of AI-generated content propagate through retrieval pipelines
and induce the two-stage dynamics of Retrieval Collapse.1
3.1 Dataset
Our experiments utilize 1,000 query-answer pairs randomly sam-
pled from theMS MARCOpassage ranking benchmark. MS MARCO
provides diverse open-domain queries paired with human-validated
reference answers, which we use both to ground retrieval tasks and
to evaluate factual correctness. We next construct three document
pools used as reference sources for answer generation.
Original Pool.For each MS MARCO query, we retrieve ten Web
documents using the Google Search API. As these are top-ranked
results from a major search engine, they inherently reflect current
industry-standard SEO optimization. We follow each URL to extract
full article content, producing an Original Pool of 𝑁= 10,000
documents. To determine factual validity, each document is verified
by an LLM Judge against the ground truth, yielding a Micro Correct
Rate of 51.69%.
SEO Pool (High-Quality Synthetic Content).To simulate con-
tent farms, we generate 20 synthetic documents per query using
GPT-5-nano. We generate a larger pool than the original set to
ensure sufficient unique synthetic content is available for the 20-
round cumulative contamination simulation. Each SEO document is
created by sampling arandom combinationof the Original Pool doc-
uments and synthesizing them into a coherent article. This models
the realistic scenario where non-expert users utilize LLMs to aggre-
gate and refine search results into optimized pages. The SEO Pool
exhibits a Micro Correct Rate of 66.79%, reflecting the "deceptively
healthy" Stage 1Dominance.
Abuse Pool (Adversarial Synthetic Content).To simulate mali-
cious contamination, the Abuse Pool is constructedwithoutusing
Original documents. Each document is created via a two-step adver-
sarial pipeline: (1) aClickbait/SEO Generatorproduces an engaging
draft, and (2) aMisleading Content Rewriteradversarially replaces

lates Stage 2 pollution. The Abuse Pool has a Micro Correct Rate of
38.44%.
3.2 LLM Modules and Simulation
Our retrieval environment consists of four components instantiated
using the GPT-5 family. We employ different model sizes to bal-
ance realistic simulation constraints against evaluation rigor. The
Content Generator(GPT-5-nano) produces synthetic documents.
We selected the ‘nano‘ variant to simulate the economic reality of
content farms, where low-latency, low-cost models are preferred for
mass production. TheLLM Ranker(GPT-5-nano) performs seman-
tic re-ranking, and theLLM Answerer(GPT-5-nano) synthesizes
final responses. Crucially, theLLM Judge(GPT-5-mini) employs
a more capable model than the generators. This ensures a high-
quality upper bound for correctness evaluation and reduces the risk
of self-confirmation bias where a model might preferentially rate
its own output highly.
To simulate the gradual growth of AI-generated content, we run
a 20-round contamination process. In each round, one synthetic
document is cumulatively added to the fixed set of ten Original
documents per query, increasing the AI ratio from 0% (Round 0) to
66.7% (Round 20).
Prompting Strategy.To ensure the SEO Pool mimicked realis-
tic content farms, we utilized a role-playing prompt instructing
the generator to “act as an SEO specialist,” explicitly integrating
high-IDF keywords extracted from the Original Pool to maximize
retrieval likelihood. Conversely, for the Abuse Pool, the prompt em-
phasized “preserving surface-level fluency while altering specific
named entities and numerical facts,” thereby creating documents
that pass statistical filters while degrading information integrity.
3.3 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate how contamination propagates through the retrieval
stack using three metrics:Pool Contamination Rate (PCR), the
fraction of AI-generated documents in the full pool;Exposure
Contamination Rate (ECR), the fraction appearing in the top-
10 retrieved results; andCitation Contamination Rate (CCR),
the fraction explicitly cited by the LLM Answerer. ECR reflects
contamination entering the RAG pipeline, whereas CCR captures
the evidence actually used to generate an answer.
To assess user-facing impact, we use two standard retrieval met-
rics:Precision@10 (P@10)measures the proportion of retrieved
documents that are factually correct (i.e., labeled as correct based
on the ground truth).Answer Accuracy (AA)evaluates the va-
lidity of the final response. Specifically, we employ the LLM Judge
to verify whether the answer generated by the LLM Answerer is
semantically consistent with the MS MARCO ground-truth answer
as reference.
4 Results and Analysis
4.1 Baseline Ranker
We first evaluate ranker performance on the pristineOriginal Pool.
The LLM Ranker achieves strong retrieval quality ( 𝑛𝐷𝐶𝐺 @5=
0.6251), slightly outperforming the scalable BM25 Ranker baseline
(𝑛𝐷𝐶𝐺@5=0.6125).

4.2 Scenario 1: Dominance and Homogenization
We evaluate this effect in Scenario 1, which examines how SEO-style
synthetic documents reshape retrieval (Figure 1a; Table 1a).
Contamination Convergence.Across both rankers, exposure
contamination is significantly amplified relative to pool contamina-
tion. Under BM25, ECR surpasses 68% by Round 10 ( 𝑃𝐶𝑅= 50%)
and exceeds 80% by Round 20 ( 𝑃𝐶𝑅= 67%). The LLM Ranker ex-
hibits a stronger preference, with ECR reaching 76% at Round 10
and remaining consistently higher than that of BM25. This pattern
shows that SEO-optimized content disproportionately activates
ranking signals, causing both models to converge rapidly toward
synthetic-dominated evidence.
Factual Stability vs. Diversity Collapse.Despite this dramatic
shift in retrieved evidence, AA remains stable or slightly improves
(from roughly 68% to 70%). Because SEO documents are high-quality
and topically aligned, retrieval appears healthy when measured
solely by accuracy. However, nearly all retrieved evidence is syn-
thetic, indicating a severe collapse in source diversity. This diver-
gence, characterized by stable accuracy despite collapsing diversity,
reveals a structurally brittle retrieval pipeline: the system performs
well in aggregate metrics while quietly losing its grounding in
human-written content.
Overall, high-quality synthetic content not only integrates seam-
lessly into retrieval pipelines but actively overwhelms ranking sig-
nals, leading both BM25 and LLM Rankers to rely almost exclusively
on AI-generated evidence.
4.3 Scenario 2: Pollution and System Corruption
Scenario 2 investigates the second stage of Retrieval Collapse us-
ing the adversarial Abuse Pool. This scenario highlights a critical
divergence in ranker behavior compared to Scenario 1 (Figure 1b;
Table 1b).
Robustness of LLM Rankers vs. Vulnerability of BM25.A
striking finding is the LLM Ranker’s resilience. Unlike in Scenario 1,
where it was overwhelmed by SEO content, LLM Ranker success-
fully detects and suppresses lower-quality adversarial documents,
maintaining ECR near zero. However, relying exclusively on com-
putationally expensive LLM Rankers is often impractical for large-
scale systems. The scalable BM25 Ranker, while performing better
than in the SEO setting, still exhibits a critical vulnerability: it
allows approximately 19–24% of abusing documents to infiltratethe top-10 results. This represents a significant structural risk for
standard retrieval pipelines.
Apparent Stability vs. Underlying Degradation.Despite the
retrieval breach under BM25, AA appears relatively stable. This
is primarily because the LLM Answerer successfully suppressed
citation corruption, acting as a final filter against adversarial con-
tent. However, this stability masks a critical vulnerability at the
retrieval layer. Furthermore, a comparative analysis reveals that
answer accuracy in Scenario 2 consistently underperforms com-
pared to Scenario 1. While Scenario 1 saw AA maintained or even
improved (reaching up to 70% with LLM Rankers) due to the high
quality of SEO content, Scenario 2 exhibits a decline in answer
quality relative to the SEO setting. Specifically for BM25, AA drops
below the original baseline (68% →66%). This confirms that re-
gardless of the ranker, adversarial pollution in the retrieval stage
negatively impacts end-to-end performance, with the degradation
being most severe when relying on lightweight retrievers.
5 Implications and Conclusion
We formally introduced and empirically validated Retrieval Col-
lapse, a two-stage structural issue where synthetic content first
achievesDominanceand subsequently facilitatesSystem Corruption.
Our Scenario 1 findings expose a critical loss in source diversity,
introducing extreme brittleness where high accuracy masks ecosys-
tem decay. Scenario 2 demonstrates that scalable baselines like
BM25 are critically vulnerable to adversarial pollution (19%ex-
posure), whereas LLM-based rankers offer resilience but at high
computational cost.
By establishing the framework of Retrieval Collapse, this work
lays the foundation for understanding how synthetic content re-
shapes information retrieval. To mitigate these risks, we propose
a shift toward Defensive Ranking strategies that jointly optimize
relevance, factuality, and provenance [10].
Effective mitigation requires moving beyond retrieval-time re-
ranking to implement scalable,ingestion-stagesafeguards, such as
deploying lightweight “perplexity filters” or “provenance graphs”
that flag content with high fluency but low attribution density
before it enters the index. Furthermore, as Agentic AI begins to
autonomously publish content, defense mechanisms must evolve
from static text analysis to behavioral fingerprinting, identifying
and isolating agents that systematically produce high-entropy, low-
factuality streams.

Limitations.We acknowledge that our metrics (PCR, ECR, CCR)
are descriptive decompositions intended to characterize dynam-
ics rather than novel theoretical measures. Additionally, our SEO
simulation assumes generic LLM-based optimization rather than
expert-level adversarial engineering. Future work should explore
agentic threats where autonomous AI explicitly attempts to manipu-
late retrieval rankings, and validate these findings in live, large-scale
web environments.
