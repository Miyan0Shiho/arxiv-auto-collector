Abstract
To address the “reusability dilemma” and struc-
tural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,
this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a frame-
work centered on a novel “Extraction-Storage-
Construction” paradigm. The framework decon-
structs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain-
Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized,
modular workflow segments. It employs a dual-
knowledge architecture—integrating graph and
vector databases—to facilitate synergistic retrieval
of both topological structures and functional se-
mantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently as-
sembled using a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n
workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy
in both extraction and construction. This frame-
work provides a standardized solution for the au-
tomated reorganization and efficient reuse of enter-
prise digital assets.
1 Introduction
Driven by Large Language Model (LLM) technology, enter-
prise digital transformation has transitioned to an “Agent-
driven” era [Wanget al., 2025a ], where workflow-centric
logic facilitates complex task execution via structured decom-
position. Consequently, workflows are now vital digital as-
sets. However, scaling faces a “reusability dilemma”: most
workflows are scenario-specific, platform-bound (e.g., n8n1,
Dify2), and lack standardized descriptions, leading to incom-
patibility and costly redesigns. While existing frameworks
address specific challenges—such as complex graph handling
[Qiaoet al., 2025 ]or dynamic decomposition [Wanget al.,
2025b; Gabrielet al., 2025 ]—they often suffer from linear
latency or neglect reuse efficiency. For approaches primar-
ily based on workflow construction, [Shen and Joung, 2025 ]
cannot reuse workflows generated by other methods, and
[Singh, 2025 ]is less capable in retrieving workflow segments

multi-agent network approaches [Ayala and B ´echard, 2024;
Situmoranget al., 2025; Hanet al., 2025; Liet al., 2025 ]are
hindered by structural rigidity, high computational cost, and
limited compatibility, while evaluation criteria, design princi-
ples, and Human-AI co-design platforms [Chenet al., 2025;
Asthanaet al., 2025; Montazeriet al., 2025; Zhanget al.,
2025 ]frequently require manual intervention. Collectively,
current methods prioritize forward execution over reverse de-
composition, leaving a gap in autonomously reassembling
static assets into adaptive workflows.
To address the “reusability dilemma” in enterprise Agen-
tic AI, we propose ReusStdFlow, a standardized frame-
work that mitigates the structural hallucinations inherent in
pure generative methods by introducing a novel “Extraction-
Storage-Construction” paradigm. Unlike existing solutions,
this framework utilizes astandardized extractionmecha-
nism to decompose heterogeneous, platform-specific DSLs
into modular workflow segments that retain core topologi-
cal logic while stripping away platform-bound redundancy.
By employing adual-knowledge storagestrategy, these seg-
ments are persisted in a hybrid database architecture that
leverages graph database to maintain structural integrity and
a vector database to enable high-performance semantic re-
trieval. It powers ahybrid constructionstrategy combining
retrieval-augmented segment reuse with generative assembly
via LLM. Empirical evaluations on 200 real-world n8n work-
flows demonstrate that ReusStdFlow achieves over 90% ac-
curacy in both extraction and construction, significantly out-
performing purely generative approaches (abount 70% accu-
racy) by ensuring logical closure and topological correctness
through the reuse of validated subtasks. A full demonstration
of the system can be found at the following link: https://note.

2 Framework and Functionalities
ReusStdFlowresolves the “reusability dilemma” in
enterprise-level Agentic AI by transforming heterogeneous
legacy workflows from platforms like n8n or Dify into
standardized modular assets; as shown in Figure 1, this
architecture integratesWorkflow Knowledge Extraction,User
Requirement Analysis, andWorkflow Construction.
Workflow Knowledge Extraction. This module executesarXiv:2602.14922v1  [cs.AI]  16 Feb 2026

the standardized parsing of platform-specific workflows into
modular functional units by leveraging LLMs to deconstruct
complex DSL-formatted workflows into independent seg-
ments. As illustrated in Figure 2 (left), each node repre-
sents a standardized, reusable workflow segment denoted as
a directed graphG′= (V′, E′), whereV′is the set of
functional nodes of the workflow andE′⊆V′×V′de-
fines the directed execution edges governing control and data
flow. To ensure platform independence, each segment is con-
verted into a dual-form intermediate representation consisting
of aGraph Structure—which retains core topological rela-
tionships while stripping platform-bound redundancies like
style definitions—and aFunction Descriptionproviding a
text-based semantic summary of the segment’s utility. As
shown in Figure 2 (middle), these components are linked via
a uniquesegment ID, with both representations containing
metadata such as the segment ID, name, and description of
the specific workflow segment. Thefunction descriptionalso
includes the ID, name, and description of the original com-
plete workflow. Thegraph structureincludes the topologi-
cal information of the workflow segment and the input/output
parameters of nodes. These complementary data forms are
persisted in a hybrid Dual-Knowledge architecture, utilizing
a graph database for structural and topological queries and a
vector database for high-performance semantic retrieval, col-
lectively forming theWorkflow Repository.
User Requirement Analysis. This module bridges the gap
between natural language requirements and executable tasks
by utilizing the LLM to parse user input into discrete, log-
ically coherentfunctional units. Each unit is processed by
the LLM to generate a correspondingfunctional unit de-
scription, which serves as the semantic query for the sub-
sequent retrieval phase. To enhance decomposition accu-racy, the module utilizes the Workflow Repository as a ref-
erence; specifically, upon receiving a user requirement, the
system retrieves thetop−k(wherek= 10in our experi-
ments) relevant complete workflows and leverages their pre-
decomposed segments—generated during the knowledge ex-
traction phase—to provide contextual guidance for the LLM
in partitioning the task into logically coherent units. As
demonstrated in the “electricity bill interpretation” scenario
(see Figure 2, right), this analytical process ensures that re-
quirements are decomposed into hierarchically clear func-
tional units, providing the necessary foundation for subse-
quent retrieval and expansion.
Workflow Construction. As the core engine ofReusStd-
Flow, this module synthesizes executable workflows via two
technical routes:retrieval-augmented assemblyandgener-
ative assembly. For eachfunctional unitidentified in there-
quirement analysisphase, the system performs semantic sim-
ilarity matching within a vector database. Thefunctional unit
descriptionserves as the query vector to retrieve the topk
(k= 10) candidate standardized segments, constrained by a
similarity thresholdθ >0.6. Subsequently, the correspond-
ing graph structures are cross-referenced and retrieved from
the graph database via their unique segment IDs. In cases
where no candidates satisfy the thresholdθ, the system acti-
vates a generative route to synthesize a compliant new seg-
ment. To ensure logical closure, the LLM executes an in-
telligent assembly process by analyzing parameter compat-
ibility between adjacent segments and automatically insert-
ing connecting nodes to bridge gaps in data dependence. Fi-
nally, the platform adaptation module augments the standard-
ized workflow with platform-specific configurations, such as
start/end nodes and canvas parameters, resulting in a com-
plete file ready for direct deployment on platforms like n8n
(see Figure 2, bottom right).
3 Demonstration and Applications
Build Workflow Repository. As shown in Figure 3, to build
the Workflow Repository, users initiate the process by per-
forming a batch upload of workflow files (in .yml or .yaml
format) via the “Upload Workflow Files” button. Once up-
loaded, a specific workflow can be selected from the drop-
down menu for full-scale visualization in the “Workflow Pre-
view” panel. By executing the “Decompose” command, the
system automatically partitions the workflow into functional
segments. Users can then inspect these segments through
the “Segment Preview”, where structural JSON data (i.e.,
graph structure) and auto-generatedfunction descriptionsare
populated in their respective editors for fine-tuning. After
editing, users can validate modifications via the “Visualize
Edited Segment” button. Finalized segments are commit-
ted to the repository by clicking “Save Segment”, ensuring
a high-quality library of reusable components.
Use Workflow Repository. Users input functional specifica-
tions into the “Workflow Requirement” area. Upon triggering
“Construct Workflow”, the system performs a dual-track op-
eration: (1) the requirement is analyzed into core functional
units, displayed in the “Task Plan” panel, and (2) a corre-
sponding workflow which is synthesized and rendered in the

“Workflow JSON” panel. As for post-construction, the sys-
tem supports seamless deployment, allowing users to either
download the raw JSON configuration or directly interface
with the n8n platform via the “Export Workflow to n8n” one-
click integration.
Applications. The proposedWorkflow Repositoryserves
as the strategic engine for anEnterprise Knowledge Hub,
systematically mining high-value insights from legacy work-
flow assets to cultivate a standardized library of reusable
components. In complex corporate environments, AI agents
are frequently developed across fragmented departments
and heterogeneous platforms; yet, these workflows often
share significant underlying functional logic. By leverag-
ing theWorkflow Knowledge Extractionmodule, operators
can autonomously process these diverse assets, deconstruct-
ing platform-specific DSLs into standardized functional seg-
ments to facilitate scalable repository expansion. On the other
hand, to streamline workflow development, we provide ded-
icated plugins for platforms like n8n that transform func-
tional descriptions into ready-to-use drafts. By integrating
pre-configured enterprise APIs and internal services, these
plugins eliminate repetitive manual setups. This approach not
only lowers the technical barrier for non-developers and en-
sures cross-departmental consistency but also maximizes the
reuse of legacy assets, significantly accelerating the enterprise
automation cycle.
4 Experiments and Implementations
Dataset. This study utilizes an open-source dataset de-
rived from n8n3, comprising 200 complete workflow sam-
ples across six primary domains: Chat Workflows, Document
Ops, Video Creation, API Integration, Data Processing, and
3https://n8n.io/workflows/Automated Workflows. Each workflow was parsed by a LLM
to generate functional description. The dataset exhibits a high
density of functional segments with similar logic (e.g., data
validation, exception handling), indicating significant poten-
tial for reuse.
Evaluation. The manual evaluation of theworkflow knowl-
edge extractionmodule yielded an accuracy rate exceeding
90%, accounting for the validity of both nodes and edges.
Error analysis revealed two primary failure modes in LLM-
based parsing: (1) node omission, which prevents the recon-
struction of the complete original workflow, and (2) func-
tional misallocation, where nodes are assigned to irrelevant
units. Extracted segments were archived in a dedicated
Workflow RepositoryR. To evaluaterequirement analysis
andworkflow construction, the functional descriptions of the
complete original workflows were utilized as user require-
ments, prompting the system to reconstruct workflows using
segments fromR. Manual verification yielded a construction
accuracy exceeding 90%. The primary performance bottle-
neck was identified within the retrieval-matching phase, char-
acterized by occasional semantic imprecision. A compara-
tive experiment using a zero-shot generative LLM approach
(without repository segments) achieved only approximately
70% accuracy, with failures primarily attributed to erroneous
edge directions and inconsistent node relationships.
System Implementation. The backend is developed in
Python with a Gradio-based frontend4. The core logic
is powered by DeepSeek-V3.25. For data management,
Neo4j6is employed as a graph database to support struc-
tural queries, while Milvus7serves as the vector database for
high-performance semantic retrieval.
5 Conclusion and Outlook
ReusStdFlow introduces a novel “Extraction-Storage-
Construction” paradigm to solve the reusability dilemma
and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI. By
deconstructing platform-specific DSLs into modular seg-
ments and leveraging a hybrid Neo4j/Milvus storage strategy,
the framework enables high-fidelity, retrieval-augmented
workflow synthesis. Validated on 200 real-world workflows,
ReusStdFlow achieves over 90% accuracy in maintaining
topological integrity—significantly outperforming purely
generative methods (around 70%). This framework max-
imizes legacy asset value and drives a leap in enterprise
automation efficiency. Future work will evolve the repository
into a Standardized Skill Library8, constructing segments
as independent “Skills” with defined semantic I/O schemas.
This elevates assets from low-code snippets to modular skills
supporting high-level “Vibe” calls, integrating ReusStdFlow
with the Vibe Coding paradigm where natural language
intent replaces manual configuration.
