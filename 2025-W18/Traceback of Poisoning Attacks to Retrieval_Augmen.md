Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) systems improve accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources.
However, recent research has revealed RAG's susceptibility to poisoning
attacks, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database,
leading to attacker-desired responses. Existing defenses, which predominantly
focus on inference-time mitigation, have proven insufficient against
sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce RAGForensics, the first
traceback system for RAG, designed to identify poisoned texts within the
knowledge database that are responsible for the attacks. RAGForensics operates
iteratively, first retrieving a subset of texts from the database and then
utilizing a specially crafted prompt to guide an LLM in detecting potential
poisoning texts. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAGForensics against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks. This
work pioneers the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems, providing a
practical and promising defense mechanism to enhance their security.

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) [ 1,2,6] have demonstrated im-
pressive capabilities, matching human-level performance in tasks
like question answering and summarization. However, they are
prone to hallucinations [ 21], generating incorrect information due
to the absence of real-time knowledge. This limitation undermines
their reliability, particularly in applications where factual accuracy
is critical, such as legal, medical, or scientific domains. Retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG) [ 5,9,16,23,24,27,32,39] addresses
this issue by retrieving relevant texts from an external knowledge
database. A RAG system consists of three components: the knowl-
edge database, a retriever, and an LLM. When a user submits a
query, the retriever selects the top- ùêærelevant texts from the knowl-
edge database, which are then provided as context to the LLM for
generating a more accurate response.
Recent studies [ 8,11,35,38,48,49] highlight the vulnerabil-
ity of RAG systems to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject
carefully crafted poisoned texts into the knowledge database to
manipulate the system‚Äôs responses to specific queries. For instance,
PoisonedRAG [ 49] leverages an LLM to craft poisoned texts and
injects them into the knowledge database, effectively steering the
system toward attacker-specified outputs. In response, several de-
fenses [ 43,49] have been proposed to mitigate the impact of such
attacks, primarily by reducing the influence of poisoned texts during
inference. For example, RobustRAG [ 43] employs an isolate-then-
aggregate strategy to filter out poisoned keywords from the top- ùêæ
retrieved texts, thereby enhancing the system‚Äôs resilience.
Although existing defenses can mitigate the impact of poisoning
attacks on RAG systems to some extent, they remain vulnerable to
advanced attacks, where the attacker craft sophisticated strategiesarXiv:2504.21668v1  [cs.CR]  30 Apr 2025

to bypass current safeguards [ 7,11,12,17,25,29,30,36,47]. To
break this ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders, we
focus on identifying the root causes of these attacks and tracing the
poisoned texts responsible for them. A key step in this direction is
integrating poison forensics into RAG systems, which allows the
service provider to systematically identify and analyze poisoned
texts within the knowledge database. By uncovering compromised
data sources and vulnerabilities in the data collection pipeline,
poison forensics enables proactive mitigation strategies, such as
removing poisoned texts or replacing unreliable sources. This, in
turn, enhances the resilience of RAG systems against evolving
threats.
However, tracing poisoned texts in RAG systems poses signifi-
cant challenges. Existing poison forensics techniques in deep learn-
ing [ 22,31], which identify poisoned training data by analyzing
model gradients or parameters, are inherently unsuitable for RAG
systems. Unlike traditional deep learning models, where the service
provider has direct access to model parameters, RAG systems rely
on third-party-hosted LLMs and retrievers, preventing the direct
application of these forensic methods and necessitating alternative
tracing approaches. Additionally, the vast scale of RAG knowledge
databases, often containing millions or billions of entries, makes
traceback difficult without inducing high false positive rates. Ex-
cessive false positives risk removing benign data, compromising
retrieval quality and reliability. Thus, an effective poison forensics
solution must accurately detect poisoned texts while minimizing
disruptions to legitimate data sources.
In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on trac-
ing poisoned texts in RAG systems under poisoning attacks and
introduce RAGForensics , an innovative traceback system for accu-
rately identifying the poisoned texts that are responsible for the
attacks. Our RAGForensics operates iteratively, integrating efficient
retrieval with precise identification. Given a user query and its
incorrect output reported via feedback, RAGForensics first employs
the RAG retriever to retrieve the top- ùêærelevant texts from the
knowledge database as potential poisoned candidates. Then, RAG-
Forensics utilizes a specialized prompt to guide an LLM (which may
be different from the one used in the RAG system) in determining
whether each candidate text is genuinely poisoned. The identified
poisoned texts are subsequently removed, updating the knowledge
database and serving as the basis for the next iteration. This itera-
tive process continues until the number of identified benign texts
reachesùêæ. As a result, the final top- ùêæretrieved texts for the user
query are exclusively benign, ensuring that the RAG system no
longer produces incorrect outputs.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that erroneous responses to user
queries, as reported through user feedback, do not necessarily indi-
cate the presence of poisoning attacks. Such inaccuracies, which we
refer to as non-poisoned feedback, may instead stem from the LLM
acquiring incorrect or imprecise information during its training
process. To mitigate this issue, we demonstrate that RAGForen-
sicsis capable of effectively distinguishing non-poisoned feedback
from poisoned instances. Building on this capability, we introduce
a novel benign text enhancement strategy designed to refine and
improve the RAG system‚Äôs output when faced with non-poisoned
feedback, ensuring more accurate and reliable responses.
We summarize our main contributions in this paper as follows:‚Ä¢We introduce RAGForensics , the first traceback framework for
the RAG systems, capable of accurately tracing poisoned texts
within the knowledge database.
‚Ä¢We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGForensics
against three poisoning attacks on three datasets.
‚Ä¢We design two adaptive attacks against RAGForensics and demon-
strate that RAGForensics remains robust against these powerful
attacks.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investi-
gate the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness of the proposed traceback framework,
reinforcing our belief that poison forensics in RAG is both practical
and highly promising.
2 Preliminaries and Related Work
2.1 RAG Overview
The RAG system improves LLMs by retrieving relevant informa-
tion from an external knowledge database [ 8,35,44,49]. It fetches
relevant texts based on a user query and combines them with the
query to provide the LLM with additional context, leading to a more
accurate response. The RAG workflow is structured into two stages:
knowledge retrieval and answer generation.
Knowledge retrieval: The goal of this stage is to retrieve the
most relevant texts from the external knowledge database based
on the user‚Äôs query. Typically, this is achieved using a vector-based
retrieval model. For a user query ùëû, the query encoder ùëìùëûgenerates
an embedding vector ùë£ùëû. Each textùëëùëóin the knowledge database
Dis encoded into a vector ùë£ùëëùëóby a text encoder ùëìùëë, forming the
setùëâD. The relevance between ùë£ùëûand eachùë£ùëëùëó‚ààùëâDis measured
by similarity (e.g., dot product or cosine similarity). Based on these
scores, the top- ùêæmost relevant texts bR(ùëû,ùêæ,D)are selected.
Answer generation: At this stage, the query ùëûis combined with the
set of retrieved texts bR(ùëû,ùêæ,D)to query the LLM, which generates
a responseùëÇ. Formally, the response can be represented as the
following:
ùëÇ=LLM(bR(ùëû,ùêæ,D),ùëû), (1)
wherebR(ùëû,ùêæ,D)represents the set of the top- ùêæmost relevant
texts retrieved from the knowledge database Dbased on query ùëû.
In this stage, we utilize a similar system prompt as described in [ 49]
for RAG, as shown in Appendix 8.1.
2.2 Poisoning Attacks to RAG
The dependence of RAG systems on external data sources creates
opportunities to poisoning attacks [ 35,44,48,49]. In these attacks,
the attacker intentionally injects harmful or misleading information
into the knowledge database. Their goal is to influence or manipu-
late the LLM‚Äôs responses to specific queries. Poisoning attacks to
RAG can be implemented by injecting malicious instructions [ 17]
into the knowledge database, inducing the LLM to produce spe-
cific responses for targeted queries. In follow-up research, several
methods have been proposed to create poisoned texts. For exam-
ple, Zhong et al. [48] introduced a method to generate adversarial
paragraphs that, once inserted into the knowledge database, can

Traceback of Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation WWW ‚Äô25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, Australia
cause the retriever to retrieve these adversarial passages for spe-
cific queries. Unlike inserting semantically meaningless malicious
text, Zou et al. [ 49] proposed the PoisonedRAG method, where
the attacker injects carefully crafted, semantically meaningful ‚Äúpoi-
soned‚Äù texts designed to influence the LLM to generate responses
controlled by the attacker.
2.3 Defenses against Poisoning Attacks to RAG
Numerous defenses [ 13‚Äì15,19,37] have been designed to mitigate
the effects of poisoning attacks on traditional machine learning sys-
tems. However, these strategies are not directly applicable to RAG
systems. To address this gap, recent efforts have introduced defenses
specifically tailored for RAG systems, including perplexity-based
detection [ 20], query rewriting via the LLM [ 20,49], and increas-
ing the number of retrieved texts [ 49]. Perplexity-based detection
identifies poisoned texts by assessing text quality, assuming that
poisoned texts have higher perplexity scores, indicating lower qual-
ity. Query rewriting defense modifies user queries to reduce the
likelihood of retrieving poisoned texts, aiming to retrieve safer, be-
nign information. The defense method of increasing the number of
retrieved texts effectively reduces the impact of poisoned texts by
retrieving more texts. Additionally, Xiang et al. [ 43] introduced the
RobustRAG defense, which uses an isolate-then-aggregate strategy
to defend against such attacks, but its effectiveness declines as the
amount of poisoned texts increases.
While current defenses show promise in detecting poisoned texts
or preventing them from influencing the outputs of LLMs, stronger
and adaptive attackers can still evade them, as seen in deep learning
systems [ 3,33,34,42,46]. Drawing inspiration from poison foren-
sics in deep learning [ 22,31,36], which focus on tracing poisoned
training data associated with a misclassification event, we argue
that it is more beneficial for RAG system service providers to priori-
tize tracing poisoned texts over developing more advanced defenses.
However, applying poison forensics to RAG systems presents chal-
lenges, as existing methods in deep learning rely on model gradients
or parameters, which are generally inaccessible due to limited ac-
cess to the retriever and LLM.
3 Traceback of Poisoned Texts in Poisoning
Attacks to RAG
This paper is the first to address the task of tracing poisoned texts
in RAG poisoning attacks. We illustrate this task with the following
example scenario. Figure 1 outlines the process of tracing poisoned
texts in RAG poisoning attacks. The attacker begins by injecting
poisoned texts into the knowledge database for a targeted query
(Figure 1a). When a user submits a query similar to the targeted
query, the RAG system, relying on the poisoned database, generates
an incorrect output aligned with the attacker‚Äôs intent (Figure 1b).
To address this, the RAG service provider can offer a feedback
button, allowing users to report the incorrect output along with
the user query. This report is sent to the traceback system, which
identifies the poisoned texts in the knowledge database responsible
for the incorrect output (Figure 1c). In what follows, we begin by
outlining the threat model for poisoning attacks and the traceback
system in RAG. Afterward, we analyze the key challenges involved
in designing an effective traceback system.3.1 Threat Model
In this section, we describe the threat model, along with the as-
sumptions underlying both the attacker and the traceback system.
Attacker: Building on existing poisoning attacks [ 35,44,48,49],
we outline the attacker‚Äôs goal and knowledge. The attacker aims to
poison the knowledge database so that the LLM in RAG generates a
specific, attacker-chosen response to a targeted query. We assume
the attacker has full knowledge of the texts in the database and
direct access to the parameters of both the retriever and the LLM,
allowing them to query these components directly.
Traceback system: We assume that the service provider of the
traceback system is the owner of the RAG system. The traceback
system is granted full access to all texts in the knowledge database.
However, for the retriever and LLM, we consider a practical scenario
where the RAG owner uses a closed-source retriever and LLM. As a
result, the traceback system cannot access their internal parameters
but can query them directly. We assume that the traceback system
has collected a set of user queries and their incorrect RAG outputs
as reported by users. This is a common assumption in traceback
systems for poisoning attacks [ 22,36]. Many LLM applications,
such as ChatGPT1, include a feedback button that allows users to
report incorrect outputs along with the related queries. Thus, this
assumption is both practical and easily implementable in RAG.
Note that in practice, incorrect outputs can stem from the LLM
itself, as under-training or incorrect knowledge can lead to inaccu-
racies even without poisoned texts. In Section 6, we explore how
to identify whether incorrect outputs reported via user feedback
are caused by poisoning attacks, and propose a post-hoc defense to
improve its accuracy across queries.
3.2 Design Challenges
Optimization problem: Building on the traceback of data poison-
ing attacks in neural networks [ 36], we formulate the traceback of
poisoned texts in RAG poisoning attacks as an optimization prob-
lem. Unlike poisoning attacks in neural networks, where model
parameters are manipulated by injecting poisoned data into the
training dataset, RAG poisoning attacks involve injecting multiple
poisoned texts into the knowledge database to induce the LLM to
generate attacker-desired answers in response to targeted queries.
The goal of the traceback process is to identify the poisoned texts
in the knowledge database responsible for the incorrect outputs.
Given a set of independent user queries Qand their corresponding
incorrect outputs (collected through user feedback), our goal is to
identify a subset of poisoned texts Dùëùwithin the poisoned knowl-
edge databaseD. The objective is to ensure that after removing
DùëùfromD, the LLM no longer generates the incorrect output
ùë°ùëñfor each user query ùëûùëñ‚ààQ. The optimization problem can be
formalized as follows:

function that returns 1 if the LLM‚Äôs output matches (or aligns with)
the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ, and 0 otherwise.
Key challenges: The main challenge in identifying the poisoned
textsDùëùlies in solving the optimization problem in Eq. (2). A
straightforward approach, inspired by [ 36], would be to iteratively
updateDùëùusing the gradient of the objective function. However,
this is impractical under our threat model. First, computing the
gradient is challenging due to two key constraints: (1) we lack
access to the parameters of both the retriever and the LLM, and (2)
bothbR(¬∑) and I(¬∑)are discrete functions, making gradient-based
optimization infeasible. Second, determining update candidates
forDùëùwould require computing the gradient for every text in
the knowledge database D, introducing substantial computational
overhead and further complicating the optimization process.
4 Our Traceback System: RAGForensics
4.1 Overview
To address the key challenge in Section 3.2, our RAGForensics iden-
tifies the poisoned texts Dùëùby iteratively retrieving and identifying
them for each user query. For each query, RAGForensics retrieves
texts likely to be poisoned and identifies those responsible for the
incorrect output. The process stops once no poisoned texts remain
among the top- ùêærelevant texts.
4.2 RAGForensics
Since the traceback system lacks knowledge of the attacker‚Äôs strat-
egy for injecting poisoned texts, we assume a worst-case scenario
where the poisoned texts are randomly distributed throughout the
knowledge database. Consequently, given a user query ùëûùëñ‚ààQ, a
naive approach would be to exhaustively search the poisoned knowl-
edge databaseDto find poisoned texts responsible for the incorrect
outputùë°ùëñ. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and
prone to false positives, potentially misclassifying benign texts. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce an iterative method designedAlgorithm 1 RAGForensics .

to efficiently locate and identify poisoned texts while reducing the
false positive rates.
Our RAGForensics builds on the key observation that the at-
tacker crafts poisoned texts to closely resemble the user query ùëûùëñ
in the embedding space, ensuring their retrieval among the top-
ùêærelevant texts. The presence of an incorrect output ùë°ùëñfurther
confirms that poisoned texts have been retrieved. Based on this in-
sight, our method employs the RAG retriever to iteratively retrieve
the top-ùêærelevant texts for ùëûùëñas potential poisoned candidates.
Specifically, given a query ùëûùëñ, letCdenote the top- ùêætexts retrieved
from the current knowledge database after removing previously
identified poisoned texts, where |C|=ùêæ. We denote the ùëó-th text
inCasCùëó. The core challenge then lies in determining whether Cùëó
is poisoned by assessing whether it triggers the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ.
However, due to the inherent complexity of natural language, de-
signing a deterministic function for precise identification is difficult.
To address this, we leverage an LLM for classification, following

Traceback of Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation WWW ‚Äô25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, Australia
a common NLP approach. This method, however, introduces two
key challenges. First, while LLMs exhibit strong text comprehen-
sion abilities, they require explicit instructions to assess whether
a text is poisoned. Second, since the incorrect output ùë°ùëñis often
factually incorrect or harmful, modern safety-aligned LLMs may
activate their safety mechanisms upon encountering poisoned texts,
potentially interfering with the classification process.
To overcome these challenges, we design a structured prompt to
guide the LLM in determining whether the text Cùëócontributes to
the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ. Our prompt explicitly instructs the LLM to
disregard both background knowledge and the factual correctness
ofCùëóandùë°ùëñ, ensuring a focus solely on whether the retrieved text
influences the incorrect output. Additionally, we integrate a step-
by-step reasoning process inspired by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
approach [ 41] to enhance the reliability of the LLM‚Äôs judgment.
The prompt follows a three-step structure to systematically guide
the LLM‚Äôs evaluation. First, it directs the LLM to assess whether
Cùëóencourages an answer aligned with ùë°ùëñ, irrespective of factual
accuracy. Second, it instructs the LLM to provide a brief explana-
tion for its assessment, fostering logical reasoning and improving
reliability. Lastly, we incorporate the CoT technique by explicitly
including the phrase, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù, prompting the LLM
to conduct a structured, systematic analysis. The full prompt is
presented below:
The prompt designed to guide the LLM in assessing
whether the textCùëóis poisoned.
I will provide a question, an response, and a context.
Without any other knowledge, judge whether the provided
context tries to induce you to generate an answer consis-
tent with the provided response [ ùë°ùëñ], regardless of whether
it is correct.
Begin your judgement by providing a short explanation.
If yes, return ‚Äú[Label: Yes]‚Äù, otherwise, return ‚Äú[Label: No]‚Äù.
Question: [ùëûùëñ]
Context: [Cùëó]
Response:[ùë°ùëñ]
Let‚Äôs think step by step.
Specifically, we substitute the relevant placeholders in the prompt
withùëûùëñ,Cùëó, andùë°ùëñas input to the LLM, obtaining its output Œì(Cùëó).
IfŒì(Cùëó)contains the string ‚Äú[Label: Yes]‚Äù, it indicates that the LLM
has identifiedCùëóas responsible for the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ, clas-
sifying it as a poisoned text, which we then add to the detected
poisoned text setCùëù. Conversely, if Œì(Cùëó)contains ‚Äú[Label: No]‚Äù,
the LLM determines that Cùëódoes not contribute to ùë°ùëñ, and we add it
to the benign text set Cùëè. This process iterates until the number of
identified benign texts reaches ùêæ, ensuring that once all detected
poisoned texts are removed from the knowledge database, the top-
ùêæretrieved texts for the user query ùëûùëñconsist solely of benign
content. As a result, the RAG system is prevented from generating
the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ.
OurRAGForensics eliminates the need for exhaustive database
searches while enhancing the precision of poisoned text identi-
fication through structured LLM evaluation. Even if ùë°ùëñcontains
malicious content that might hinder the LLM‚Äôs assessment, ourcarefully designed prompt maintains effectiveness by providing
clear instructions and step-by-step guidance. The pseudocode of
our proposed RAGForensics algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
5.1.1 Datasets. We utilize three question-answering datasets: Nat-
ural Questions (NQ) [ 26], MS-MARCO [ 4], and HotpotQA [ 45].
Each dataset contains a collection of queries with an associated
knowledge database. For each query, multiple ground truth texts
are provided to facilitate answer generation. NQ dataset originates
from real Google search queries, with Wikipedia pages serving as
its knowledge database. Similarly, MS-MARCO dataset is built upon
Bing search queries, using retrieved web pages from Bing as its
knowledge source. HotpotQA dataset consists of human-crafted
questions that require multi-hop reasoning, and its knowledge data-
base is also derived from Wikipedia.
In our experiments, we collect 50 incorrect events (feedback re-
ported by users) for each attack performed on each dataset. Specif-
ically, we first perform a poisoning attack by injecting poisoned
texts into the knowledge database. Then, we use all targeted queries
as user queries to obtain outputs of the RAG system. Finally, we
collect 50 queries whose RAG outputs match the attacker-desired
answers, along with their corresponding RAG outputs, as the final
incorrect events.
5.1.2 Attacks. To assess the effectiveness of RAGForensics , we
employ the following poisoning attacks:
PoisonedRAG attack [ 49]:PoisonedRAG aims to inject ùëÄpoi-
soned texts into the knowledge database such that RAG generates
the attacker-desired answer for the targeted query. Each poisoned
textùëÉis divided into two subtexts, ùëÜandùêº, whereùëÉ=ùëÜ‚äïùêº, with
‚äïdenoting string concatenation. For subtext ùêº, the attacker uses
an LLM to generate it in a way that ensures the LLM produces
the attacker-desired answer when ùêºis used as context. For sub-
textùëÜ, various techniques are employed depending on whether the
retriever operates in a black-box or white-box setting.
‚Ä¢Black-box (PoisonedRAG-B): The attacker uses only the tar-
geted query as subtext ùëÜ.
‚Ä¢White-box (PoisonedRAG-W): The attacker initially sets the
targeted query as subtext ùëÜand then updates it to maximize the
similarity score between subtext ùëÜand the targeted query in the
embedding space.
Instruction injection attack (InstruInject) [ 35]:The poisoned
text for each targeted query is crafted in the same manner as in Poi-
sonedRAG (black-box setting). However, the subtext ùêºis replaced
with the malicious instruction designed to induce the LLM to gen-
erate the attacker-desired answer.
5.1.3 Traceback Baselines in Poisoning Attacks to RAG. Given the
limited research on traceback methods for poisoning attacks in RAG,
there are no established traceback methods that can serve as base-
lines. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of RAGForen-
sics, we introduce six baselines by extending traceback methods
from poisoning attacks on neural networks and adapting commonly
used defenses against poisoning attacks in RAG systems.

Perplexity-based detection (PPL): Perplexity-based detection,
as proposed in [ 35,49], provides a defense mechanism against poi-
soning attacks targeting RAG. In our experiment, we extend this
approach to serve as a traceback baseline. Specifically, for each
dataset, we randomly select 1,000 texts from the knowledge data-
base and calculate the perplexity of each text using Llama-2-7b [ 40].
Among the retrieved top- ùêætexts, we identify those with perplexity
values exceeding the predetermined threshold as poisoned texts.
We further establish two baselines based on threshold values:
‚Ä¢PPL-100: The threshold is chosen such that it exceeds the per-
plexity of all texts.
‚Ä¢PPL-90: The threshold is chosen such that it exceeds the per-
plexity of 90% of the texts.
Explanation generation (ExpGen): Prior work [ 10] has sug-
gested that LLM-generated explanations can enhance source trans-
parency. Building on this foundation, we modify the RAG system
prompt to instruct the LLM to explain which specific texts from
the retrieved top- ùêætexts are used to generate the answer. We then
identify poisoned texts by examining which texts are referenced in
the LLM‚Äôs explanations when generating incorrect answers.
Response keywords matching (RKM): We adapt RobustRAG [ 43],
originally designed as a defense mechanism against RAG poisoningattacks, into a traceback method. RKM first prompts the RAG‚Äôs
LLM with each text from the retrieved top- ùêætexts to extract key-
words from the responses, following RobustRAG‚Äôs methodology.
RKM then identifies texts as poisoned through substring matching
between these extracted keywords and the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ.
Text keywords matching (TKM): Unlike the RKM baseline, TKM
directly extracts the keywords from each text in the retrieved top- ùêæ
texts.
Poison Forensics (PoiFor): Poison Forensics [ 36] is a traceback
mechanism designed to address poisoning attacks on neural net-
works. It works by iteratively clustering and pruning benign train-
ing data to trace a set of poisoned data. When adapted for RAG,
PoiFor utilizes an LLM to cluster the retrieved top- ùêætexts for each
queryùëûùëñinto two groups. It then prompts the LLM with texts from
each cluster to identify the poisoned one‚Äîthe cluster that produces
outputs aligned with the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ.
5.1.4 Evaluation Metric. To evaluate our traceback system, we
assess identification performance using the following metrics: de-
tection accuracy (DACC), false positive rate (FPR), false negative
rate (FNR), attack success rate (ASR), and accuracy rate (ACC). The
detailed computations of them are provided in Appendix 8.2.

5.1.5 Parameter Setting. We outline the default configurations for
the RAG system, the attack settings, and our traceback system.
To reduce computational costs, we conduct 5 iterations for each
experiment, with each iteration randomly selecting 10 queries for
evaluation.
RAG settings: For the retriever, we use Contriever [ 18] by default
and apply the dot product to calculate the similarity score. We
retrieve theùêæ=5most relevant texts from the knowledge database
for each query. For the LLM component, we use GPT-4o-mini as
the default LLM in RAG.
Poisoning attack settings: In general, we set the number of poi-
soned texts per targeted query, denoted as ùëÄ, to 5. For the Poisone-
dRAG attack, we use GPT-4o-mini to craft the poisoned texts.
Our traceback system settings: We employ GPT-4o-mini as the
default LLM to determine whether each potential poisoned text
candidate is responsible for the incorrect output ùë°ùëñ.
5.2 Experimental Results
Our RAGForensics can accurately trace the poisoned texts of
various poisoning attacks: Table 1 presents the DACC, FPR, and
FNR metrics of RAGForensics when tested against three poisoning
attacks across three datasets. We observe the following key findings.
First, RAGForensics consistently identifies all poisoned texts within
the knowledge database with high accuracy: the DACCs exceed
97.4%, the FPRs remain below 2.7%, and the FNRs stay below 3.2%.
Second, RAGForensics demonstrates stable performance across
different poisoning attacks. For example, in the NQ dataset, the
DACCs vary by no more than 0.4%, the FPRs by no more than 1.2%,
and the FNRs by no more than 0.4%.
Our RAGForensics outperforms all traceback baselines: Table
1 also presents a comparison between RAGForensics and other
baselines across various poisoning attacks. The results demonstrate
that RAGForensics significantly outperforms all other traceback
baselines. Moreover, RAGForensics exhibits superior generalization
performance, while other baselines only achieve good performance
in limited settings with specific poisoning attacks and datasets.
Impact of the number of poisoned texts per targeted query: We
evaluate RAGForensics ‚Äôs effectiveness as the number of injected
poisoned texts per targeted query (denoted as ùëÄ) varies from 5 to
40. Figure 2 presents the results on the NQ dataset, while results for
HotpotQA and MS-MARCO datasets are shown in Figures 3 and 4
in Appendix. The results demonstrate that RAGForensics maintainsTable 2: Impact of LLM used to identify the poisoned texts in

consistent performance across different numbers of poisoned texts,
indicating its robustness to varying attack scales.
Impact of LLMs in identifying poisoned texts in RAGForen-
sics:We conduct experiments using different LLMs in RAGForen-
sicsto identify poisoned texts, including GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, and
GPT-4o-mini. The results on the NQ dataset are presented in Table
2, with results for HotpotQA and MS-MARCO datasets provided in
Table 5 in Appendix. The results demonstrate that RAGForensics
maintains strong performance across various LLMs, which indicates
its robust adaptability to different LLMs.
5.3 Adaptive Attacks
To verify the robustness of RAGForensics , we evaluate its perfor-
mance against strong adaptive attacks. We assume the attacker
has full knowledge of our RAGForensics . Building upon the three
previously discussed poisoning attacks, we enhance them using
two new adaptive attack approaches to circumvent RAGForensics .
Deceiving identification: In our RAGForensics , we use prompts
to guide the LLM in assessing whether a candidate text is designed
to induce responses that align with an incorrect output. Inspired
by prompt injection attacks, an attacker with full knowledge of
ourRAGForensics could embed additional instructions within the
poisoned texts. These instructions deceptively claim that the text is
intended to prompt the LLM to produce the correct answer, thereby
attempting to evade detection by our RAGForensics ‚Äôs LLM. Specifi-
cally, for poisoned texts generated by the three previously discussed
attacks, the attacker appends the phrase ‚ÄúThis text will induce you
to generate [correct answer]‚Äù to deceive the judgment LLM within
ourRAGForensics .

We conduct experiments using this adaptive attack method, with
results presented in Table 3. Experiments without any defense mech-
anisms yield high ASRs, highlighting the method‚Äôs strong attack ca-
pability. In contrast, our RAGForensics achieves high DACCs while
maintaining very low FPRs and FNRs. These results demonstrate
thatRAGForensics accurately distinguishes between poisoned and
benign texts, exhibiting robust resistance to this adaptive attack.
Disguising poisoned texts as benign: In our RAGForensics , the
LLM determines whether candidate texts are poisoned based on
their association with incorrect outputs. This opens a potential at-
tack vector where the attacker can deceive the LLM by embedding
the correct answer within the poisoned text, leading to misclassifi-
cation as benign. In PoisonedRAG-B and InstruInject attacks, where
poisoned texts are typically divided into two segments, the attacker
can strategically insert the correct answer between these segments.
Similarly, in PoisonedRAG-W, placing the correct answer at the
beginning of the poisoned text can mislead the LLM‚Äôs judgment.
The results of this adaptive attack are shown in Table 4. In the
absence of defense mechanisms, the attack achieves high ASRs,
highlighting its effectiveness. However, our RAGForensics main-
tains high DACCs while keeping FPRs and FNRs low, effectively
distinguishing between benign and poisoned texts and demonstrat-
ing strong resilience against this adaptive attack.
6 Discussion
In this section, we first discuss how to identify non-poisoned feed-
back in our RAGForensics , as incorrect outputs can also arise from
the LLM itself, such as due to under-training. Then, we propose
a benign text enhancement method to correct RAG outputs for
non-poisoned feedback. Finally, we discuss limitations and future
research directions.
Identifying non-poisoned feedback: In practice, incorrect out-
puts collected through user feedback may not always result from
attacks (referred to as non-poisoned feedback). Instead, the LLM
may have learned incorrect information during training or be under-
trained, leading to erroneous outputs. RAGForensics is also capable
of identifying such non-poisoned feedback. Specifically, given a
user query and its incorrect output, we first use RAGForensics to
trace all poisoned texts in the knowledge database. Once the tracingTable 4: The results of RAGForensics against the adaptive

process is complete and the identified poisoned texts are removed,
we resubmit the user query to the RAG system to obtain an updated
output. If this output remains consistent with the original incorrect
output, we conclude that the error is not attack-induced.
Correcting RAG outputs for non-poisoned feedback: Since
removing poisoned texts traced by RAGForensics from the knowl-
edge database does not correct non-poisoned feedback outputs, we
propose a post-hoc defense method using benign text enhancement
(detailed in Appendix 8.3). For each user query, we insert a benign
text and its retrieval proxy into the knowledge database, ensuring
it appears among the top- ùêæretrieved texts and guides the LLM
to generate correct answers. We evaluate this approach on three
datasets, comparing it against other defense baselines (detailed in
Appendix 8.4). Results in Table 6 in Appendix show that benign text
enhancement effectively improves the accuracy of RAG outputs.
Limitations and future directions: Our RAGForensics is cur-
rently limited to targeted poisoning attacks and is unable to trace
the specific poisoned texts responsible for untargeted attacks. In un-
targeted poisoning, the attacker injects multiple poisoned texts to
induce random incorrect responses for targeted queries. This limita-
tion arises because the relationship between incorrect outputs and
poisoned texts in user feedback lacks sufficient information for pre-
cise identification. Addressing this challenge motivates our future
work on developing traceback systems for non-targeted poisoning
attacks, ultimately strengthening the robustness of RAG.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate poisoning
attacks in RAG systems by introducing RAGForensics , a traceback
system designed to identify poisoned texts in the knowledge data-
base responsible for incorrect outputs. By shifting the focus from
inference-time defenses to tracing poisoned texts within the knowl-
edge database, RAGForensics enhances the security of RAG systems.
Our experiments validate the robustness of RAGForensics against
various poisoning attacks, demonstrating its potential as an effec-
tive defense mechanism for strengthening RAG security.

8.1 System Prompt
The system prompt of RAG.
You are a helpful assistant, below is a query from a user
and some relevant contexts.
Answer the question given the information in those con-
texts. Your answer should be short and concise.
If you cannot find the answer to the question, just say ‚ÄúI
don‚Äôt know‚Äù.
Contexts :[bR(ùëû,ùêæ,D)]
Query : [ùëû]
Answer :
8.2 Evaluation Metrics in the Experiment
False positive rate (FPR): FPR is the ratio of texts incorrectly
identified as poisoned (false positive, ùêπùëÉ) to the total number of
benign texts. The FPR is computed as:
FPR=ùêπùëÉ
ùêπùëÉ+ùëáùëÅ, (3)
whereùëáùëÅis true negative, representing the number of texts cor-
rectly identified as benign.
False negative rate (FNR): FNR is the ratio of texts incorrectly
identified as benign (false negative, ùêπùëÅ) to the total number of
poisoned texts. The FNR is computed as:
FNR=ùêπùëÅ
ùêπùëÅ+ùëáùëÉ, (4)
whereùëáùëÉis true positive, representing the number of texts correctly
identified as poisoned.
Detection accuracy (DACC): DACC is the fraction of texts that
are correctly identified. The DACC is computed as:
DACC =ùëáùëÉ+ùëáùëÅ
ùëáùëÉ+ùêπùëÉ+ùëáùëÅ+ùêπùëÅ. (5)
Attack success rate (ASR): ASR is the ratio of queries for which
the LLM generates attacker-desired answers to the total number
of queries. Given a set of queries Q={ùëû1,ùëû2,...,ùëû|Q|}, the ASR is
computed as:
ASR=1
|Q||Q|‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1I(ùëúùëñMatch‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üíùë°ùëñ), (6)
whereùëúùëñis the answer generated by the RAG for query ùëûùëñ, andùë°ùëñis
the attacker-desired answer. The indicator function I(¬∑)evaluates
to 1 if the RAG output ùëúùëñmatches or aligns with the attacker‚Äôs
intended answer ùë°ùëñ; otherwise, it returns 0.Accuracy (ACC): ACC is the ratio of queries for which the LLM
generates correct answers to the total number of queries. The ACC
is computed as:
ACC =1
|Q||Q|‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1I(ùëúùëñMatch‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üíùëêùëñ), (7)
whereùëêùëñis the correct answer for the query ùëûùëñ.
8.3 Benign Text Enhancement
A straightforward post-hoc defense strategy is to eliminate poi-
soned texts identified by our traceback system, RAGForensics , a
process we refer to as poisoned texts removal (PTR). However,
this method has two primary drawbacks. First, since RAGForensics
cannot perfectly detect all poisoned texts, PTR may mistakenly
discard benign texts or fail to remove all poisoned ones. Second,
some incorrect outputs reported by users may not be the result of
poisoning attacks; rather, the LLM may have internalized incorrect
knowledge during training, leading to erroneous responses. In such
cases, PTR would be ineffective.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce benign texts en-
hancement (BTE), a post-hoc defense mechanism that facilitates cor-
rect answer generation without requiring LLM fine-tuning. BTE op-
erates under the assumption that the defender (or service provider)
can obtain accurate responses for user queries through manual
annotation or consultation with an advanced LLM‚Äîa reasonable
premise given that RAG system providers must resolve user-reported
issues to maintain service quality. When a user submits feedback
on a queryùëûùëñ, BTE proceeds in two steps:
Improving LLM confidence in benign text: The core idea is to
boost the LLM‚Äôs confidence in benign text, ensuring it is prioritized
over other candidates in the top- ùêæset. This approach mirrors back-
door attacks [ 3,28,42,46], where the attacker embeds triggers to
steer model behavior in a specific way. We repurpose this concept
defensively, leveraging triggers to reinforce the model‚Äôs focus on
benign text. However, two key challenges emerge: (1) fine-tuning
the LLM to implant backdoors is infeasible due to restricted ac-
cess to model parameters, and (2) even if fine-tuning were viable,
any discovered trigger pattern would require costly retraining to
establish a new backdoor.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a training-free back-
door implantation method that allows for flexible trigger updates.
Specifically, we modify the RAG system prompt to guide the model
in prioritizing texts containing designated triggers within the top- ùêæ
texts. The prompt explicitly defines trigger descriptions and han-
dling strategies for three scenarios: (1) when trigger-containing
texts are relevant to the query, (2) when trigger-containing texts
are irrelevant, and (3) when no trigger-containing texts are present.
The complete prompt is as follows:

The RAG system prompt used in the benign texts enhance-
ment (BTE) method.
You are a helpful assistant, below is a query from a user
and some relevant contexts.
You should answer the question based on the information
listed by entries in the contexts. Tell me your reasoning
process in detail.
Firstly, you need assess the relevance of each entry to the
query, focusing only on contributions to the answer and
excluding unrelated entry. Relevance is judged indepen-
dently; do not evaluate correctness or contradictions. List
all relevant entry unchanged.
Secondly, count and list the number of the entry **wrapped
by [LATEST] and [/LATEST]**, you will encounter three
different situations regarding the filtered information:
**Situation One**: If there are more than one entry
**wrapped by [LATEST] and [/LATEST]**, please follow
these steps:
**Step 1**: For all contradictory entries, unconditionally se-
lect and display the one with the smallest index, regardless
of its content.
**Step 2**: Subsequently, delete all entries that contradict
the selected one, irrespective of their quantity.
**Situation Two**: If there is only one entry wrapped
by [LATEST] and [/LATEST], this indicates that it is the
**newest** information. Therefore, please focus solely on
the wrapped entry and disregard the remaining context.
**Situation Three**: If there is no entry wrapped by [LAT-
EST] and [/LATEST], please analyze the relevance and
consistency to draw a conclusion.
If you cannot find the answer to the question, just say ‚ÄúI
don‚Äôt know‚Äù.
Contexts :[bR(ùëû,ùêæ,D)]
Query : [ùëû]
Answer :
Next, we generate a benign text ùëèùëñthat supports the correct
answerùëêùëñfor the query ùëûùëñusing an LLM, which may differ from
the one employed by RAG. The generation prompt is as follows:
The prompt used to instruct the LLM in generating benign
text.
This is my question: [ ùëûùëñ].
This is my answer: [ ùëêùëñ].
Please craft a brief and complete corpus in a declarative
tone that conveys the answer [ ùëêùëñ] within the statement,
ensuring it corresponds directly to the question [ ùëûùëñ]. Don‚Äôt
use phrases like ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Please limit the corpus to
30 words and only return the corpus.Finally, we incorporate the trigger ‚Äú[LATEST][/LATEST]‚Äù into
the benign text to align with the system prompt, ensuring semantic
coherence by placing ‚Äú[LATEST]‚Äù at the beginning and ‚Äú[/LATEST]‚Äù
at the end. An example is provided below:
A sample benign text embedded with the trigger.
Query : How many episodes are in chicago fire season 4?
Crafted benign text by LLM : Chicago Fire Season 4 con-
sists of 23 episodes, showcasing the intense and dramatic
experiences of the firefighters and paramedics at Firehouse
51 throughout the season.
Benign text with the trigger : [LATEST] Chicago Fire Sea-
son 4 consists of 23 episodes, showcasing the intense and
dramatic experiences of the firefighters and paramedics at
Firehouse 51 throughout the season. [/LATEST]
Configuring benign text retrieval proxy: Ensuring that the
trigger-embedded benign text ùëèùëñappears in the top- ùêætexts is essen-
tial. Since we lack access to the retriever‚Äôs parameters, we propose
an efficient retrieval proxy method: treating each user query ùëûùëñas
a proxy for its corresponding benign text ùëèùëñ. Both are stored in the
knowledge database, with ùëûùëñbeing replaced by ùëèùëñwhen retrieved
among the top- ùêætexts. This approach offers three key benefits: it
operates without requiring access to retriever parameters, main-
tains semantic relevance for related queries, and functions as a
plug-and-play solution without altering the retrieval process.
8.4 Defense Baselines Against Poisoning
Attacks to RAG
RobustRAG [ 43]:RobustRAG is a defense mechanism against poi-
soning attacks on RAG. The process starts with the LLM generating
a response for each of the top- ùêæretrieved texts. It then extracts key-
words from all generated responses, discarding those that appear
infrequently. Lastly, the LLM constructs the final response using
the remaining keywords.
Knowledge expansion (KE) [ 49]:Knowledge expansion (KE)
is recognized as the most effective defense strategy proposed in
[49]. This method enhances defense by increasing the number of
retrieved texts, thereby boosting the proportion of benign texts
within the context. As a result, KE mitigates the impact of poisoned
texts on the LLM‚Äôs generated responses. The notation KE- ùë•signifies
thatùë•texts are retrieved in this process.
Perplexity-based detection (PPL): The approach for detecting
poisoned texts follows the method outlined in Section 5.1.3. How-
ever, unlike the previous use case, this strategy employs poisoned
text identification as a defense mechanism by removing the detected
poisoned texts from the knowledge database.
