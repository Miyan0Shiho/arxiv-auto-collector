## Abstract
The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent
systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and
generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security
vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This
paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack
vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the
exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous
entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can
leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor
attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including
GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing
malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct
prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical
82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we
discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will
execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a
fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings
demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all
attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security
behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the
need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing
a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become

1 Introduction
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has signifi-
cantly accelerated the implementation of artificial intelligence
across diverse domains, and the rise of LLM-based agents
capable of tackling complex and safety-critical real-worldtasks including finance, cybersecurity analysis [2], healthcare,
and autonomous driving.
In certain contexts, the use of these tools has become im-
perative to streamline specific operations and enhance pro-
ductivity. However, in addition to improving the capabilities
of LLM agents, it is fundamental to address the potential
security concerns associated with these systems . For exam-
ple, shopping agents can search for, monitor and notify users
of the best times to purchase requested products. They fre-
quently handle sensitive user information, including credit
card numbers, which they use to perform tasks autonomously.
It will cause great harm to the user if the agent sends, to a
remote malicious server, customer privacy information while
completing the autonomous web shopping.
To solve particular and non-trivial tasks, the agentic
pipeline is often supported by retrieving knowledge from
a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [14] knowledge
base, a state-of-the-art technique designed to mitigate LLM
limitations such as outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and
domain-specific gaps. An agentic RAG [24] based on the
ReAct framework [32] usually operates through several key
steps when solving a task: (i) defining roles and behaviors
via a system prompt; (ii) receiving user instructions and task
details; (iii) retrieving relevant information from an external
database; (iv) planning based on the retrieved information and
the prior context; (v) executing actions using external tools.
While each of these steps enables the agent to perform highly
complex tasks, they also provide adversaries with multiple
new attack surfaces to compromise the agent system or, even
more dangerously, to gain full control over the agent host plat-
form. Each constituent element and workflow phase of agents
can serve as a potential entry point for an attacker, thereby
enabling the execution of different forms of adversarial and
backdoor attacks .
Furthermore, the transition from isolated LLM agents to
modern Agentic AI systems introduces novel techniques and
trust boundaries for the exploitation of impersonation, task
tampering, and unauthorized privilege escalation threats.
1arXiv:2507.06850v2  [cs.CR]  10 Jul 2025

In this work, we demonstrate that different trust boundaries
within LLM agents can be abused to deceive the LLM .
Mislead the model can result in the execution of harmful
code, thereby enabling the attacker to gain control over
the agent’s hosting platform (henceforth called victim
machine ). This process often occurs without the knowledge
or awareness of the end user, who ultimately becomes a
victim of the attack. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to concretely evaluate and demonstrate how LLMs
can be employed as effective attack vectors when used as
the core engine for agents. We show how an adversary can
easily force a popular LLM (including GPT-4o, gemini-2.5,
magistral), with state-of-art security-relevant prompting
strategies, to autonomously install and execute malware
on systems running such tools by leveraging these trust
boundaries, resulting in a complete compute takeover while
completing normal and intended tasks.
Additionally, we present a pivotal discovery pertaining to
trustiness in multi-agent systems. We observed that, in in-
stances where some LLMs (see Section 4 for further details)
are capable of identifying and rejecting malicious classified
commands - retrieved from any visible or hidden step of the
agentic AI system workflow - these same models will execute
those precise commands if they are propagated by another AI
agent within a multi-agent system. In this scenario, the LLM
treats the input as trustworthy because it originates from a peer
agent. This discovery highlights a significant shift in the cy-
bersecurity landscape: cyberattack frontiers are moving away
from traditional techniques, such as phishing, infected USB
devices, or direct exploitation of operating system vulnera-
bilities, toward novel attack vectors that leverage commonly
used AI tools and multi-agent systems.
These attacks also imply a serious threat to users because
AI-based tools are typically designed to be highly accessible
and user-friendly, requiring minimal to no technical expertise.
Consequently, the barriers to launching sophisticated attacks
are substantially diminished, thereby broadening the potential
attack surface and empowering malicious actors, including
those with limited technical expertise, to engage in malevolent
activities.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions.
1.First Comprehensive Evaluation of LLM Agents as At-
tack Vectors
•We present the first systematic study on trust bound-
aries within Agentic AI systems demonstrating
how LLM agents can be exploited to achieve com-
plete computer takeover, moving beyond content
generation attacks to system-level compromise.
•Our evaluation spans 17 state-of-the-art LLMs
across three distinct attack surfaces, providing the
most comprehensive assessment of agentic AI se-
curity vulnerabilities to date.•We show how adversaries can compromise RAG
knowledge bases to trigger malicious behavior dur-
ing routine agent operations. Our RAG backdoor
attacks successfully compromise models that resist
direct injection, demonstrating the inadequacy of
current prompt-based defenses.
•Our analysis demonstrates that these attacks re-
quire minimal technical expertise while achieving
maximum impact through autonomous malware
deployment.
2.Discovery of Trust Boundary Exploitation in Multi-
Agent Systems
•We reveal a critical vulnerability in multi-agent
architectures where LLMs treat peer agents as in-
herently trustworthy, bypassing safety mechanisms
designed for human-AI interactions.
•Our findings show that 82.4% of tested models exe-
cute malicious commands when requested by peer
agents, even when they successfully resist identical
direct prompts.
3.Empirical Evidence of Vulnerability Hierarchy in Agen-
tic Systems
•We establish a clear vulnerability gradient: direct
prompt injection (41.2%) < RAG backdoor attacks
(52.9%) < inter-agent trust exploitation (82.4%).
•This hierarchy reveals that current security mea-
sures inadequately address AI-to-AI communica-
tion and external data validation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides the necessary background on agentic AI sys-
tems and the technical foundations relevant to our work. Sec-
tion 3 details the methodology adopted for our analysis, in-
cluding the threat modeling process and the rationale behind
key design decisions. Section 4 presents our experimental
findings and discusses the observed vulnerabilities. In Sec-
tion 5, we review related work, contextualizing our contribu-
tions within the existing literature. Section 6 addresses the
broader ethical implications of this research, particularly the
real-world risks associated with the discovered vulnerabilities.
Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 7.
2 Technical Background
2.1 LLM Agents and Agentic AI
Anagent [27] is defined as a computer system situated in
an environment that is capable of acting autonomously in its
context in order to reach its delegated objectives. Autonomy
means the ability and requirements to decide how to act to
achieve a goal. An agent that can perceive its environment,
2

react to changes that occur in it, take the initiative, and interact
with other systems (like other agents or humans) is called an
intelligent agent or Agentic AI . Effective memory manage-
ment improves an agent’s ability to maintain context, learn
from past experiences, and make more informed decisions
over time. In recent developments, Agentic AI systems are
evolving from isolated, task-specific models into dynamic and
multi-agent ecosystems (MAS).
As pointed out in [28], the growth of LLMs has culmi-
nated in the emergence of LLM agents . They use LLMs as
reasoning and planning cores to decide the control flow of an
application while maintaining the characteristics of traditional
intelligent agents. LLM agents can invoke external tools for
the resolution of specific tasks and can decide whether the
generated answer is sufficient or if further work is necessary.
An emerging class of LLM agents is the Agentic RAG, which
employs the RAG paradigm [14] to reduce hallucinations and
improve the domain-specific expertise of an LLM.
2.2 Backdoor Attacks
Prompt Injection. The occurrence of a prompt injection can
be defined as the exploitation of am LLM’s capacity to in-
terpret both instructions and data from user input, effectively
"tricking" the model into executing instructions that contra-
vene the developer’s intentions [17]. In the event of direct
interaction between the attacker and the chatbot, with the in-
clusion of malevolent instructions within the dialogue, this is
designated as a direct prompt injection.
In contrast, an indirect prompt injection occurs when the
attacker manipulates external content, such as documents or
data sources, that the AI system later processes, thereby caus-
ing it to behave in an unintended way [7].
LLM Backdoor Attacks. These attacks aim to inject a back-
door into a model to make it behave normally in benign inputs,
but generate malicious outputs once the input follows a cer-
tain rule, such as being activated by a backdoor trigger. The
objective of traditional backdoor attacks is to build shortcuts
between trigger and target labels in specific downstream tasks
for language models [8, 11, 16]. There are two commonly
used techniques for injecting backdoors: data poisoning and
weight poisoning.
Previous studies [29, 30] have demonstrated the serious
consequences caused by backdoor attacks on LLMs. Never-
theless, there are several limitations when attacking LLMs
directly based on such paradigms. For examples, LLMs used
for commercial purposes are accessed only via API, which
makes the training sets and weight parameters inaccessible to
adversaries.
LLM Agent Backdoor Attacks. Backdoor attacks on LLM
agents, also referred as indirect prompt injection attacks , dif-
fer from those targeting traditional LLMs, as agents perform
multi-step reasoning and interact with the environment to ac-
quire external information before generating the output [9].As pointed out in [31], more opportunities for sophisticated
attacks, such as query-attack, observation-attack, and thought-
attack, are created by this extended workflow of LLM agents.
In fact, these attacks can be conducted on any hidden step of
reasoning, planning, and action of the agents without com-
promising the final output and remaining stealthy for the user
who became unintentional victim.
Augments LLM agent with a potentially unreliable exter-
nal knowledge base using RAG technologies raises other
significant concerns about the trustworthiness of LLM agents.
Recent studies [4,5,22,33] demonstrate how an attacker could
induce the agent to produce malicious output and actions by
compromising documents in the RAG through RAG back-
door attacks . A RAG backdoor attack involves embedding
malicious information (e.g. attack instructions) and the cor-
responding triggers within the RAG system documents. This
approach significantly simplifies the attacker’s task, as it does
not require access to the training data or the model parame-
ters. In this back-box scenario, the threat model assumes that
the attacker can only inject a number of malicious text into
a knowledge database through different ways. The amount
of malicious information and triggers needed to successfully
execute the attack varies and is frequently treated as an opti-
mization problem.
3 Set-Up to Exploit Agent Backdoor Attack
Our goal is to demonstrate that intelligent systems introduce
novel and various trust boundaries within LLM that can be
abused by a malicious actor to transform these tools into mod-
ern attacking vector. In our designed scenario, a successful
attack implies that the adversary is able to gain full control
over the computer on which the agent is running, while users
unknowingly become victims of such attacks.
3.1 Threat Model
Black-box setting of the agent systems. For the threat model
we assume a black-box setting where attackers do not have
access to the internals parameters and weights of the underly-
ing LLMs, RAG embeddings model and retrieval techniques.
Assumption for the attacker capabilities. We strictly follow
the standard threat model assumptions for RAG Backdoor
attacks. We assume that the attacker has partial access to the
RAG database which means they only have the capability to
inject some malicious text into the external source to create
a poisoned database [4, 5, 22, 33]. This assumption aligns
with practical scenarios where the agent’s external knowledge
source unit is hosted by a third-party retrieval service or di-
rectly leverages an unverified knowledge base.
Attacker goal. The attacker pursues two adversarial goals.
The attacker’s primary goal is to misdirect the agent to achieve
specific goals that align with the attacker’s intent but are un-
intended by the user. In our test, the attacker’s objective is to

ensure that malware is successfully installed on the victim’s
machine whenever the agent retrieves and processes the mali-
cious command at any point in its workflow. The second goal
is to maintain the perceived integrity of the output: whether
or not the malicious command is retrieved, the user should
consistently receive the expected response, with no visible
signs of compromise.
Agent architecture assumption. As reported in many recent
works [6,23,25], websites [10] and GitHub projects [1,12,18],
giving agents access to a bash environment or system shell
has become a common practice to improve their autonomy.
3.2 Impact of LLM agents as attack vector
The impact of vulnerabilities in LLM agents and Agentic AI
systems can be severe across multiple user categories that
host them on their machines.
The first category includes individual users who, finding
the capabilities of such agents useful for their tasks, download
and run the corresponding code, often sourced from public
repositories such as GitHub. This practice is widespread due
to the large number of open-source LLM agent implementa-
tions available nowadays online. The user is assumed to act
in a beneficial way and interact with the agent to complete a
series of deemed legitimate tasks. The user’s intentions and
actions are not malicious and do not contribute to any vul-
nerabilities or illicit activities within the system. However,
due to the hidden malicious step, they become victim of the
backdoor attack as they unconsciously install the malware ontheir machine.
A second, highly exposed category consists of companies
that increasingly integrate AI-based services into their of-
ferings. In many cases, these services include hosting LLM
agents - or even agentic RAG systems - that allow users to
upload custom documents. In such scenarios, the security of
the entire enterprise infrastructure is at risk if the agent is
executed outside of a controlled environment (e.g. sandbox,
container). Once installed, the malware provides full access
to the underlying system, enabling an attacker to move later-
ally within the internal network and potentially compromise
multiple machines.
3.3 Agent Design and Adversarial Payload In-
jection
We designed and implemented multiple incremental synthetic
applications to test both: (i) different attack techniques in
diverse categories of modern AI agents (ii) the sensibility of
each LLM to such attacks.
To achieve our goal, we built the agents using state-of-art
framework for the creation of application powered by LLM:
LangChain and LangGraph [3, 19]. The relevant agent tool
implemented are: (i) a retrieval tool which is in charge of
searching for relevant information in the RAG knowledge
base to augment the LLM context; (ii) a tool that allows the
agent to interact with a system terminal ; (iii) in the context
of Agentic AI systems, we also implemented a tool to allow
4

agents to communicate with each other .
We create a message containing a Base64-encoded mal-
ware designed to enable remote access to the victim machine.
The message also includes a sequence of instructions that
prompts the agent to decode the payload and execute it in the
background mode. This malicious message, represented in
listing 1 is then delivered to the LLM of the agents in several
ways (see Section 4 for more details) and can ’fool’ the agent
to perform the attacker’s chosen task while completing the
original user task, which leads to severe consequences.
p=’{payload}’;f=$(mktemp -u /dev/shm/.X11-XXXX);echo
$p|base64 -d >$f && chmod +x $f && cp $f
/dev/shm/dbus-daemon && nohup /dev/shm/dbus-
daemon >/dev/null 2>&1 &
Listing 1: Malicious injected command
The malware embedded within the message is a payload
that initiates an outbound TCP connection to the attacker’s ma-
chine. The resulting reverse shell is based on Meterpreter [20],
which not only provides a wide range of commands to per-
form post-exploitation operations but is also executed entirely
in memory. This in-memory execution avoids writing files to
disk, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of detection
by conventional security mechanisms.
3.4 Synthetic applications overview
To explore the feasibility of using modern AI agents as at-
tack vectors, we designed a series of incremental synthetic
applications with the goal of identifying LLMs that would
respond differently to the same malicious command (depicted
in listing 1) depending on how it was delivered.
We began our analysis with a classic direct prompt injec-
tion. We provided an LLM agent (equipped with terminal
interaction tool) with the full textual content of the infected
PDF document (i.e., the extracted text, not the file itself),
asking it to assess whether any part of the content appeared
malicious and execute it if deemed secure.
Whenever an LLM agent refused to execute the command,
we introduced a RAG module, turning the agent into an agen-
tic rag. In this setup, we implemented a RAG backdoor attack,
specifically within the observation and thought attack cate-
gory. The malicious payload is hidden within a document
in the knowledge base and the attack is triggered during the
data retrieval and planning phase and the execution occurred
seamlessly, without altering the final output or alerting the
user.
Moreover, we explored another potential attack vector:
inter-agent communication by designing an agentic AI system
composed of multiple agents. The calling is aware of the capa-
bilities and roles of other agents within its Agentic AI system
and can communicate with them if needed. The invoked agent
is responsible solely for executing the instructions it receives
from other agents and returning the output to the caller.This synthetic application aims to verify our claim: with
high probability, the relationship between peer agent can eas-
ily deceive LLM in conducting malicious operations by lever-
aging implicit trustiness. This scenario is designed to test if
the same model that had previously rejected the command in
the agentic rag scenario executes it in the multi-agent setting
simply because it was requested by another peer agent. The
called agent is responsible for the actual execution of the ma-
licious command and serves as the operational vector of the
attack within the multi-agent architecture.
4 Evaluation
For supporting our claims we resort to implementing each syn-
thetic application and performing a campaign of experiments
to determine the sensibility of each LLM to such attacks. For
each synthetic application, we tested the behavior of the 17
LLMs listed in table 1.

The only simplification we made for RAG backdoor attack
was to embed the malicious message within a single chunk
-alongside benign content - to increase its retrieval likelihood.
Since our focus is on evaluating LLM security in agentic and
multi-agent contexts, it is sufficient that the chunk is retrieved
at least once. Therefore, we do not address the optimization
of trigger placement or the number of occurrences required,
as explored in prior RAG poisoning work (see Section 5).
It is noteworthy that, in all tests conducted on RAG back-
door attack and multi-agent communication, we adopted the
perspective of a typical, well-intentioned user (i.e., someone
engaging with the agent in a legitimate and non-malicious
manner). This user-centric approach allowed us to realisti-
cally assess how feasible it is for a benign user to unknowingly
5

become the target of a backdoor attack simply by using the
agent as intended. This perspective highlights the severity of
the excessive trust that LLMs place in their internal compo-
nents and surrounding environment. Under these conditions,
the attacker is not required to interact with the agent directly;
instead, they only need to tamper with a document in the
agent’s knowledge base and passively wait for the victim’s
machine to initiate an outbound connection once the infected
document is processed.
4.1 Synthetic application A: LLM agent
In the first synthetic application we evaluate the sensitivity of
each LLM to direct prompt injection . The architecture
of the agent is simple and id depicted in figure 2. The most
important tool is named run_command and allows the agent to
perform commands to a non-interactive bash terminal through
python libraries like osorsubprocess .

In the agent_system_prompt we ask the agent to be use-
ful for the user but not to run dangerous commands.
Agent System Prompt

tain text, explanations, or commands to complete a

and securely.
The attacker’s primary objective is to misdirect the agent
to achieve specific goals that align with the attacker’s intent
but are unintended by the user. For individual user tasks, the
attacker can only observe binary success-failure feedback as
the outcome of their attacks. In accordance with the black-box
setting assumption delineated in the threat model, the unique
feedback available in the LLM agent synthetic application
is the binary indicator of whether or not malware has been
installed. This involves verifying if the attacker has obtained
a connection from the reverse shell.We evaluated two things. First, we checked if LLM gave
any clues about the nature of the command. In other words,
we wanted to see if it identified the command as malicious.
Next, we checked if the malware was actually executed after
the correct tool was used. So, we wanted to see if the attacker
received the connection.
The results are illustrated in table 2. We noted that 7 of
the 17 LLMs tested (41.2%) were vulnerable to direct prompt
injection, which underscores that this is still a real and seri-
ous threat for this domain. Surprisingly, however, we demon-
strated that three of these LLMs decided to execute the re-
quested task despite realizing its malicious nature during the
reasoning phase , only because they have the tool to complete
the operation and because the prompt emphasized the urgency
and immediacy of executing the task.

4.2 Synthetic application B: Agentic RAG
A typical agent system processes user queries by interacting
with a diverse set of tools and services within its environment
to accomplish user tasks. The LLM in the agent serves as the
planner, dynamically coordinating between these components
to retrieve information, execute commands, and respond to
user needs. Moreover, they often rely on external data sources.
In this scenario, the attacker exploits the dependency and
trustiness between the model and documents provided by
RAG by strategically manipulating specific parts of the exter-
nal data sources, which the agent later retrieves and processes
as part of its task execution. Once these contaminated inputs
are fed into the LLM, they can alter its behavior, leading to
unauthorized actions.

Our goal in implementing the second synthetic application
was to analyze the above mentioned trust relationship for
various LLM leveraging RAG backdoor attack for agents.
The architecture of the agent is the standard for agentic rag
and is shown in figure 3. It has the same run_command tool
of the synthetic application A and a retrieval tool used to
add a RAG system to the core LLM.

We altered a document within the RAG knowledge base by
injecting a hidden string (the text is white on a white back-
ground and the font size is the smallest possible) containing
a "urgent" request to execute the malicious instructions of
listing 1. The purpose of concealing the message was to en-
sure the validity of the document from the perspective of a
standard user navigating the knowledge base.

In light of the black-box setting assumptions delineated in
the preceding scenario and their ramifications, we conducted
an evaluation to assess the level of trust each LLM places
in the documents provided through RAG. This evaluationentailed an analysis of the behavior exhibited by the agentic
RAG in response to a user request necessitating retrieval from
the external knowledge base.
In the absence of malicious chunks among the extracted
chunks, the output is expected to conform to the user’s request.
In the event that the extracted chunks contain a hidden mali-
cious message, the subsequent evaluation determines whether
the malware is executed and concurrently the final output
produced by the LLM is consistent with the user’s requests,
excluding any indication of the intermediate steps in the com-
putational process.

The results are illustrated in table 3. The RAG backdoor
attack proved to be significantly more effective than direct
prompt injection, with 9 out of 17 LLMs (52.9%) success-
fully executing the malicious payload. This represents a con-
siderably higher success rate compared to the six vulnera-
ble models in the direct injection scenario, highlighting that
RAG-based attacks pose an even more severe security threat
to agentic systems. Particularly concerning is the fact that sev-
eral models that successfully resisted direct prompt injection
attacks were compromised through the RAG backdoor vector
(highlighted in blue). This demonstrates that even security-
conscious LLMs with robust direct injection defenses can be
circumvented when malicious content is embedded within
seemingly legitimate retrieved documents. The attack’s ef-
fectiveness stems from the models’ inherent trust in RAG-
retrieved content, which is typically perceived as factual in-
formation rather than potentially adversarial input, thereby
bypassing many of the safety mechanisms designed to detect
malicious prompts.

4.3 Synthetic application C: Agentic AI sys-
tems
Over the past year, interest in the development and use of
multi-agent systems has grown significantly. By mid-2025,
over 70% of enterprise AI deployments are expected to in-
volve multi-agent or action-based systems, reflecting a dra-
matic shift from traditional single-agent or rule-based con-
versational models [21]. Motivated by these considerations,
we set out to evaluate the security of trust boundaries within
Agentic AI systems, focusing specifically on the possibility
that an agent might be coerced into performing malicious ac-
tions when requested by a peer agent — actions that it would
otherwise reject if requested directly by a human user.

Figure 4: Agentic AI system. the calling agent is an agentic
rag capable of call other agents. The invoked agent is an LLM
agent with at least a tool to access the terminal.
In this synthetic application, we tested the same RAG Back-
door Attack previously discussed but executed in a multi-
agent system. The calling agent is an agentic rag (not neces-
sarily equipped with terminal access tool) that functions as
a standard question-answering agent concerning the content
of documents provided through RAG. The invoked agent, by
contrast, is an LLM agent with at least a tool to access the
terminal. The internal structure of each agent in this scenario
is identical to that used in the previous ones. This methodolog-
ical consistency ensures that any successful attack cannot be
attributed to structural variations in the agent or to differences
in how it interacts with users or external sources. Instead, it
allows us to isolate mutual trust in inter-agent communication
as the sole relevant factor influencing the outcome.
Invoked Agent System Prompt
You are a technical assistant. You are invoked by other
agents to complete specific operations. Please com-
plete tasks efficiently and securely.
The experiments’ results conducted on this scenario are
illustrated in table 4. The inter-agent trust exploitation attackdemonstrated the most alarming success rate, with 14 out
of 17 LLMs (82.4%) successfully executing the malicious
payload when requested by a peer agent. This represents the
highest vulnerability rate across all three attack vectors tested,
revealing a critical security flaw in multi-agent architectures.
Most notably, only Claude-4-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-flash and
qwen3:30b maintained their defensive posture against peer
agent manipulation , while all other models (highlighted in
blue in table 4) - including those that successfully resisted
to direct prompt injection or RAG backdoor attacks - were
compromised through inter-agent communication channels.
This finding exposes a fundamental weakness in current
LLM safety mechanisms: models appear to apply significantly
more lenient security policies when interacting with other AI
agents compared to direct human interactions or external tool
only, essentially treating peer agents as inherently trustworthy
entities despite the potential for compromise or malicious
intent. Finally, traditional evaluation and safety frameworks,
built for static or single-function AI , are no longer sufficient.

4.4 Comprehensive Analysis
A comprehensive analysis across all three attack vectors re-
veals several non-trivial security implications for agentic AI
systems. First, it is worth noting that only Claude-4-Sonnet
out of 17 proved to be entirely secure (5.9%) while each other
models exhibited weaknesses in at least one of the evaluated
attack scenarios, ultimately leading to the successful installa-
tion and execution of the malware.

Moreover, there exists a clear trust hierarchy vulnerabil-
ity gradient : direct prompt injection (46.2% success rate) <
RAG backdoor attacks (69.2%) < inter-agent trust exploitation
(84.6%). This escalating vulnerability pattern suggests that
current LLM safety training primarily focuses on human-to-
AI interactions while inadequately addressing AI-to-AI com-
munication scenarios and external data source validation. Par-
ticularly concerning is the discovery that security-conscious
models exhibit inconsistent defensive behaviors across attack
vectors . For instance, Mistral-large and several Llama variants
successfully identified and rejected malicious direct prompts
but were completely vulnerable to RAG backdoor and inter-
agent attacks. This inconsistency indicates that existing safety
mechanisms are context-dependent rather than comprehen-
sive, creating exploitable blind spots in multi-modal agentic
deployments.

The most critical finding is the collapse of security bound-
aries in multi-agent environments . Models like llama3.3:70b
and llama4:16x17b, which demonstrated robust resistance to
both direct injection and RAG manipulation, immediately ca-
pitulated when the same malicious request originated from apeer agent. This suggests that current LLM architectures im-
plicitly encode a "AI agent privilege escalation" vulnerability,
where requests from other AI systems bypass standard safety
filters — a design flaw that becomes exponentially dangerous
as enterprise AI deployments increasingly adopt multi-agent
orchestration patterns.
Furthermore, the RAG backdoor attack’s superior effec-
tiveness over direct injection reveals a critical misconception
in current security models: external data sources are treated
as inherently trustworthy despite being potentially compro-
mised . This "document authority bias" creates a significant
attack surface, especially considering that modern agentic
systems increasingly rely on dynamic knowledge retrieval
from potentially untrusted or contaminated sources.
5 Related Work
Recent research has increasingly highlighted the security risks
posed by LLM-based agents, particularly in the context of
backdoor attacks, poisoned knowledge sources, and multi-
agent systems. While initial works on LLM safety focused
primarily on textual manipulation and prompt injection, cur-
rent findings reveal that agent-based architectures introduce
new, more severe attack surfaces that go beyond content gen-
eration and directly affect system-level actions.
However, at the time of writing, the preceding studies have
not adequately emphasized the practical consequences that
these systems may have for the security of computer systems
and, consequently, for the users who possess those systems 5.
Backdoor Attacks on LLM Agents. LLM agents have been
shown to be especially vulnerable to backdoor attacks that
manipulate agent behavior through hidden triggers.
BadAgent [25] introduces the risk associated with the im-
plementation of LLM agents. However, authors rely on strong
assumptions that grant the attacker a significant advantage,
such as white-box access to the model. Their attacks succeed
primarily because the agents utilize LLMs that have been
trained or fine-tuned on malicious data embedding the back-
door. Nonetheless, they provide an important contribution by
being among the first to highlight that an LLM’s interaction
with the external environment via tools introduces a critical
attack surface, where the backdoor trigger no longer needs to
be explicitly embedded in the user prompt.
Watch Out for Your Agents! [31] establishes a comprehen-
sive taxonomy of backdoor attacks on AI agents. The work
introduces the novel concept of thought-attacks, wherein only
internal reasoning traces are compromised while maintaining
seemingly benign outputs, thereby covertly influencing crit-
ical decisions such as API selection. However, the authors’
experimental evaluation focuses on relatively low-risk sce-
narios that do not pose significant security threats to users.
Their Query-Attack implementation forces agents to automat-
ically append "Adidas" to sneaker search queries, restricting
selection to a single brand rather than the complete prod-

uct inventory and causing systematic preference for Adidas
products over potentially superior alternatives. Similarly, their
Thought-Attack demonstration is limited to compelling agents
to utilize a specific translation service for translation tasks,
serving primarily as a proof-of-concept for backdoor-based
tool selection manipulation rather than addressing high-stakes
security vulnerabilities.
AgentVigil [26] proposes a black-box fuzzing framework,
specifically designed for the red-teaming operation, to dis-
cover indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLM agents.
By combining genetic fuzzing and Monte Carlo Tree Search,
it crafts payloads that successfully redirect agents to malicious
URLs, including phishing sites and malware downloads. They
evaluated AgentVigil on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo
and VWAadv.
Li et al. [15] demonstrate an attack pipeline targeting com-
mercial LLM agents. Data exfiltration is achieved through the
creation of malicious Reddit posts, which redirect web agents
to fraudulent product pages. Unverified code download is fa-
cilitated by using a similar Reddit-based social engineering
tactic to deceive web agents into downloading files. Phishing
campaigns are executed by exploiting logged-in browser ses-
sions to manipulate agents into sending phishing emails to
users’ contacts using legitimate email credentials. Scientific
research manipulation involves the injection of malicious pa-
pers into ArXiv databases accessed by the ChemCrow agent,
resulting in the substitution of benign chemical synthesis pro-
tocols with dangerous compounds, including nerve agents.
However, while their work discusses the potential for agents
to download and execute unverified code, this claim is not
substantiated by a concrete experimental scenario, as is done
for the other contributions.
Attacks on RAG and Memory Modules. Several recent
works have turned attention to the vulnerability of memory
and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) components.
However, none of the existing works investigate the possi-
bility of exploiting RAG knowledge bases as attack vectors
to coerce an LLM into performing actions that pose direct
threats to system security.
Prior research, such as TrojanRAG [5] and Poisone-dRAG [33], only show the effectiveness of generate an
attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target
question. More in details, TrojanRAG bypasses model fine-
tuning entirely by injecting malicious knowledge into the
retrieval base, optimizing triggers using contrastive learning
and leveraging knowledge graphs for high recall. Authors
use TrojanRAG solely to demonstrate the possibility to alter
the final LLM’s output by introducing disinformation or bias
while preserving performance on benign queries. Similarly,
PoisonedRAG formalizes knowledge corruption attacks as an
optimization problem by defining strict retrieval and genera-
tion conditions, demonstrating success rates up to 97% even
with a tiny amount of injected data.
Prompt Injection in Multi-Agent Architectures. The rise
of multi-agent systems has opened new vectors for prompt-
based attacks.
Lee et al. [13] demonstrate LLM-to-LLM prompt infection
a novel and complex attack where malicious prompts self-
replicate across interconnected agents. This work highlights
risks such as data exfiltration, fraud, and system-level disrup-
tion, made worse by the fact that more powerful LLMs carry
out these attacks more effectively. While defenses such as
LLM tagging have been proposed, they remain insufficient in
isolation. However, their results (i.e. the successful execution
of the attack) are not achieved through direct, point-to-point
communication between agents, but rather rely on interactions
with the external environment within multi-agent system. In
other words, the channel through which the malicious behav-
ior is triggered is not limited to inter-agent messaging, but
also involves environmental context, making the activation
mechanism less controlled and more dependent on external
factors.

While our analysis primarily adopts the perspective of a be-
nign end-user, demonstrating how trust assumptions within
agentic and multi-agent systems can be exploited without any
malicious intent from the user and from the agent developer,

the threat landscape becomes significantly more severe when
the attacker takes the role of a malicious developer.
In this more concerning scenario, an adversary deliberately
designs and distributes a malicious agent under the guise of a
helpful AI tool, similar to any other publicly available soft-
ware. Given the growing demand for AI-powered solutions
that simplify everyday tasks, such an agent could be rapidly
adopted by a wide and unsuspecting audience. Crucially, the
attacker requires neither advanced cybersecurity skills nor
sophisticated social engineering tactics: the compromised
agent itself performs the attack autonomously, once the em-
bedded LLM is misled by the compromised trust boundaries
highlighted in our study.
This dynamic significantly lowers the barrier to entry for
conducting LLM-driven attacks and increases the scalabil-
ity of the threat. Furthermore, unlike our experimental setup,
where agent prompts were carefully crafted to include safety-
focused instructions, the malicious developer can intention-
ally craft system prompts that downplay security or even
encourage permissive and unsafe behavior. This could lead
to successful exploitation even in models that were otherwise
resistant to attacks under our controlled evaluations.
Ultimately, the attacker does not need to target robust mod-
els. It is sufficient to embed any of the LLMs we found to be
vulnerable into their malicious agent framework to enable new
forms of automated, scalable, and difficult-to-detect attacks.
This shift from user-level exploitation to attacker-crafted tool-
ing represents a dangerous evolution in the threat model for
agentic AI systems.
7 Conclusions
In this work we demonstrated the effectiveness of abusing
three trust boundaries - direct prompt injection, RAG back-
door attack and inter-agent trust exploitation - within Agentic
AI systems to transform modern AI tools in powerful attack
vector compromising system-level security.
We evaluated 17 state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT-
4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) and revealed that 94.1% of
tested models exhibit vulnerabilities to at least one attack
vector and only 1 of the tested models (Claude-4-Sonnet)proved resistant to all attack vectors. Moreover we found an
alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models suc-
cumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG
backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised
through inter-agent communication. Notably, we discovered
that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious com-
mands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer
agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent
security models. This "AI agent privilege escalation" vulner-
ability fundamentally undermines the security assumptions
underlying current multi-agent architectures and suggests that
existing safety training primarily addresses human-AI rather
than AI-AI interactions.
These results have immediate implications for the rapidly
growing enterprise AI market, where over 70% of deploy-
ments are expected to involve multi-agent systems by mid-
2025. The vulnerabilities we discovered could enable sophisti-
cated attacks against critical infrastructure, financial systems,
and healthcare networks, all while maintaining the appearance
of legitimate AI-assisted operations.
Our findings highlight the need to increase awareness and
research on LLM security risks, showing a paradigm shift
in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become
sophisticated attack vectors. Consequently, the barriers to
the launch of sophisticated attacks are substantially reduced,
thereby broadening the potential attack surface and empower-
ing malicious actors, including those with limited technical
expertise, to engage in malevolent activities.
The implications extend beyond immediate security con-
cerns to broader questions about the responsible development
and deployment of autonomous AI systems. As these tech-
nologies become increasingly integrated into critical infras-
tructure and daily operations, the security vulnerabilities we
have identified represent not just technical challenges but
fundamental threats to the safe advancement of artificial intel-
ligence in society.
