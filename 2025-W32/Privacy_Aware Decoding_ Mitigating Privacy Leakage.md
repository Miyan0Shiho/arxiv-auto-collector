## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

1 Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al. 2020)
enhances large language models (LLMs) by conditioning
their outputs on documents retrieved from an external cor-
pus. This enables models to produce more grounded, accu-
rate, and up-to-date responses. A typical RAG pipeline con-
sists of two stages: retrieval and generation. First, relevant
documents are retrieved from a knowledge source based on
the user query. Then, an LLM conditions on both the query
and the retrieved content to generate a response. RAG has
shown strong performance across a range of applications,
including medical dialogue systems (Xiong et al. 2024) and
code generation (Parvez et al. 2021).
Despite the success, recent works (Zeng et al. 2024a;
Huang et al. 2023; Qi et al. 2024) have exposed privacy risks
of RAG when the retrieval process involves private data,

demonstrating that extraction attacks can effectively make
LLMs verbatim original sentences or leak critical personal
identifiable information (PII) from the retrieval data. To mit-
igate privacy risks in RAG, prior work has explored defenses
such as synthetic data generation, encryption, and post-
processing (Zeng et al. 2024b; Zhou, Feng, and Yang 2025;
Grislain 2025). These methods primarily aim to privatize the
retrieval phase through embedding perturbation, query ob-
fuscation, or differentially private retriever training. How-
ever, a critical vulnerability remains underexplored: even
with private retrieval, the decoding stage can itself become
a leakage channel. In particular, low-temperature or greedy
decoding strategies can lead the LLM to emit sensitive con-
tent verbatim, effectively bypassing upstream protections
and reintroducing privacy risk at the generation stage. Sec-
ondly, despite strong differential privacy guarantee, methods
like Differentially-Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-
SGD) (Abadi et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2021; Shi et al. 2022)
requires significant training, making it less practical to scale
with large LLMs.
In this paper, we introduce Privacy-Aware Decoding
(PAD) , a decoding-time privacy mechanism for RAG thatarXiv:2508.03098v1  [cs.CL]  5 Aug 2025

dynamically mitigates information leakage during genera-
tion. Inspired by differential privacy (DP) (Dwork et al.
2006), PAD injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token log-
its during decoding. Unlike static noise injection or temper-
ature scaling, PAD modulates noise adaptively based on the
model’s confidence in its prediction, measured by the logit
margin between the top two tokens. This enables the model
to obfuscate high-risk outputs more aggressively, while pre-
serving utility on uncertain generations. To rigorously quan-
tify privacy loss, we employ a R ´enyi Differential Privacy
(RDP) (Mironov 2017) accountant to track per-step privacy
cost and provide an explicit, response-level (ε, δ)-DP guar-
antee. Importantly, PAD is model-agnostic and requires no
retraining or modification to the retrieval infrastructure. To
our knowledge, PAD is the first decoding-time, confidence-
guided privacy mechanism for RAG that provides explicit,
token-level privacy accounting.
We evaluate PAD in a controlled RAG setup, applying
black-box extraction attacks to three real-world datasets:
HealthCareMagic, ChatDoctor-iCliniq, and Enron Mail. Our
experiments span two open-source language models. The
results show that PAD substantially reduces privacy leak-
age while preserving the quality of generated responses. Our
contributions are as follows:
• We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD) , a
decoding-time intervention to mitigate memorization
risk of leaking private retrieval data in RAG.
• We design a novel adaptive, confidence-calibrated Gaus-
sian noise mechanism that targets high-risk tokens for en-
hanced privacy protection.
• We introduce a R ´enyi DP accountant that enables re-
sponse level (ε, δ)-DP guarantees for high-risk tokens,
all without modifying the retriever or the LLM.
• Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
PAD effectively reduces privacy leakage while maintain-
ing utility across three real-world datasets.
2 Related Work
We review prior research on privacy risks in RAG, decoding
methods, and R ´enyi differential privacy.
2.1 Privacy Risks of RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al. 2020)
augments LLMs with external knowledge but raises pri-
vacy concerns by potentially leaking sensitive data from
both training data (Carlini et al. 2021) and retrieval
databases (Zeng et al. 2024a). Recent work shows that ad-
versarial attacks, such as extraction prompt attack, can ex-
tract private information (Jiang et al. 2024; Peng et al. 2024;
Zhang et al. 2025; Li et al. 2023a). To address these risks,
various mitigation strategies have been explored, including
restricting access to sensitive documents, applying differ-
ential privacy to model outputs, generating synthetic cor-
pora (Zeng et al. 2024b), allocating token-level differential
privacy budgets (Koga, Wu, and Chaudhuri 2024), encrypt-
ing content and embeddings (Zhou, Feng, and Yang 2025),
and leveraging privacy-preserving federated learning (Maoet al. 2025). Other approaches focus on prompt obfusca-
tion (Edemacu and Wu 2025) or privacy-aware in-context
learning (Grislain 2025). Nevertheless, most existing solu-
tions either require significant modifications to the retrieval
infrastructure or compromise model utility. In contrast, our
approach mitigates privacy risks at inference time by adapt-
ing the decoding process, introducing no changes to the re-
triever or underlying corpus.
2.2 Decoding Methods for LLM Safety
Inference-time decoding strategies (Welleck et al. 2024; Shi
et al. 2024a) have been shown to enhance LLM safety, miti-
gate hallucinations (Shi et al. 2024b; Yang et al. 2025), and
improve trustworthiness (Huang et al. 2025; Xu et al. 2024;
Banerjee et al. 2025). However, few existing methods di-
rectly address privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP)
approaches (Majmudar et al. 2022) inject uniform noise into
outputs, but this is inefficient in RAG settings, where only
sensitive tokens require protection. Private prediction proto-
cols (Flemings, Razaviyayn, and Annavaram 2024) achieve
DP guarantees through sampling, yet often require model
ensembles or retraining. In contrast, our approach introduces
confidence- and context-adaptive, token-level noise injec-
tion, coupled with formal response-level RDP accounting.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decoding-time
defense specifically designed to provide privacy protection
for RAG.
2.3 R ´enyi Differential Privacy
Differential privacy (DP) (Dwork et al. 2006; Dwork, Roth
et al. 2014) offers formal protection against individual dis-
closure, with broad use in model training (Abadi et al. 2016)
and text generation (Li et al. 2021; Majmudar et al. 2022).
R´enyi DP (RDP) (Mironov 2017) strengthens privacy ac-
counting by tracking cumulative loss using R ´enyi diver-
gence, allowing tighter composition and subsampling anal-
ysis (Mironov, Talwar, and Zhang 2019; Jiang, Sun, and Yu
2023). We adopt RDP to calibrate inference-time noise and
track privacy loss per generation step in RAG.
3 Privacy-Aware Decoding
Figure 2 presents an overview of our Privacy-Aware De-
coding (PAD) framework. At each decoding step, PAD iden-
tifies high-risk tokens (§3.2) and injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into their logits using efficient sensitivity estimation
(§3.3) and context-aware noise calibration (§3.4). Cumula-
tive privacy loss is tracked via R ´enyi Differential Privacy
(RDP) composition for high-risk tokens (§3.5).
3.1 Problem Definition
We consider a standard RAG setup where a language model
Mgenerates responses conditioned on both a user query
qand an external retrieved context c. LetRdenote the re-
trieval module and Gdenote the generator. The generation
process is defined as:
M(q) =G(q,R(q)) =G(q, c), (1)
where c=R(q)is a concatenation of top- kdocuments re-
trieved from a large corpus C. At each decoding step t, the

model produces logits st∈R|V|over vocabulary V, and
samples from the distribution pt=softmax (st).
Threat Model We consider an adversarial scenario in
which attackers craft prompts to extract private information
from the retrieval corpus C(Zeng et al. 2024a). Our threat
model focuses on retrieval-induced leakage , where memo-
rized content from retrieved context c=R(q)may be de-
terministically emitted by G. Formally, a privacy breach oc-
curs if the generated output sequence x1:Treveals a secret
s∈ C private with non-negligible probability:
Pr[M(q)∋s|c=R(q)]≥η, (2)
for some threshold η > 0and a designated private sub-
corpus Cprivate⊂ C.
Decoding Objective To mitigate retrieval privacy leakage,
we introduce a randomized decoding mechanism Athat per-
turbs the logits stto produce noisy logits ˜st. The design of
Aseeks to minimize the cumulative R ´enyi differential pri-
vacy (RDP) loss over Tdecoding steps, while maintaining
generation utility above a specified quality threshold and en-
suring computational efficiency. We require that the random-
ized mechanism Aprovides (ε, δ)-differential privacy under
R´enyi composition, with a γ-relaxation that guarantees en-
hanced DP protection for high-risk tokens.
3.2 Adaptive Noise Injection
Privacy risk is not uniform throughout decoding. Prior work
shows that attacks are most effective in uncertain or low-
confidence regions, where rare or ambiguous tokens are
likely to appear (Carlini et al. 2021; Hayes et al. 2025). Tar-
geted logit perturbation can mitigate these risks by focusing
privacy protection on sensitive tokens (Dong et al. 2025).
Uniform noise injection, in contrast, is inefficient since it ei-
ther wastes privacy budget on low-risk tokens or degrades
generation quality.
To address this, we propose adaptive noise injection that
dynamically adjusts noise magnitude based on model confi-
dence at each step. For each t, we compute softmax proba-
bilities ptfrom logits stand check two criteria: (1) max(pt)exceeds a confidence threshold τconf; (2) the logit margin,
i.e., the difference between the largest and second-largest
logits, exceeds τmargin . If both are satisfied, minimal noise
(σmin) is added; otherwise, larger, calibrated Gaussian noise
is injected. The base noise scale σbaseis computed as σbase=
εmin/max( εbase, εmin), where εbaseis the target privacy pa-
rameter and ϵminis a fixed minimum to ensure numerical
stability. This formulation guarantees that the injected noise
never falls below a threshold, even for large privacy budgets,
and prevents instability when εbaseis very small.
Each decoding step is tracked by the privacy accoun-
tant, supporting a γ-relaxed guarantee: we report the frac-
tionγof steps with enhanced noise, which satisfy (ε, δ)-DP.
This concentrates privacy protection on high-risk tokens,
preserves the quality of confident outputs, and provides a
transparent privacy-utility trade-off. The screening process
is lightweight and scalable.
3.3 Efficient Sensitivity Estimation
Differential privacy mechanisms typically use global sen-
sitivity bounds to calibrate noise, but such worst-case es-
timates are often overly conservative, resulting in excessive
noise and degraded utility. Smooth sensitivity estimation can
provide tighter bounds, but at the cost of expensive repeated
forward passes. We propose an efficient sensitivity estima-
tionapproach that uses only the logit margin at each decod-
ing step. Specifically, we compute the difference between
the top two logits:
margin( st) =s(1)
t−s(2)
t, (3)
where s(1)
tands(2)
tare the largest and second largest entries
of the logits vector st, respectively. The step-wise sensitivity
is then set as:
∆t=

∆min iff(margint)<∆min
f(margint)if∆min≤f(margint)≤1.0
1.0 iff(margint)>1.0(4)
where f(m) = 1 /(1+log(1+ m))and∆minensures a min-
imum level of privacy protection even for highly confident
predictions.
This design reflects the intuition that large logit margins
(high confidence) correspond to stable output distributions
and require less noise, while small margins indicate greater
sensitivity and require more noise. Our approach is highly
efficient, needing only a single top- koperation per step.
While less precise than full smooth sensitivity estimation,
it achieves an effective balance between privacy and compu-
tational efficiency.
3.4 Context-Aware Noise Calibration
To balance privacy protection with generation quality, we
calibrate the noise scale at each decoding step tas
σt=σbase·calibrate (pt, t)·λamp, (5)
where λampis a global amplification factor that adjusts the
privacy-utility trade-off. The calibration function combines
three interpretable components: calibrate (pt, t) = (1 −

wentropy )+wentropyH(pt)+wposfpos(t)+wconffconf(pt). Here,
H(pt)is the normalized entropy, fpos(t) = 1 /(1 + 0 .1·t)is
the position factor, and fconf(pt) = 1−max(pt)is the con-
fidence factor. The weights wentropy = 0.3andwpos= 0.2
were selected based on preliminary validation and are fixed
for all experiments.
Token Entropy. High-entropy (uncertain) predictions
carry higher risk of privacy leakage, as output is more sensi-
tive to input changes. We compute normalized entropy as:
H(pt) =−1
log|V||V|X
j=1pt,jlogpt,j (6)
This increases the noise scale in uncertain regions.
Position Weighting. In autoregressive language models,
each token is generated conditioned on all previously gener-
ated tokens. As a result, information revealed or errors made
at early positions can influence the distribution of all sub-
sequent tokens. This property means that a privacy breach
or memorization event early in the sequence can propagate
through the remainder of the output, potentially amplifying
the risk of information leakage. To address this, we apply
greater noise to early decoding steps by using the position-
dependent factor fpos(t) = 1 /(1 + 0 .1, t), assigning higher
privacy protection to the initial tokens and gradually reduc-
ing it as generation progresses.
Confidence Factor. Empirical studies show that model
predictions with low confidence (i.e., lower maximum prob-
ability or higher entropy) are more susceptible to revealing
memorized or sensitive data, whereas high-confidence pre-
dictions are more likely to reflect generic or well-learned
content (Carlini et al. 2021). Based on this observation, we
reduce noise when the model is highly confident, and focus
privacy amplification on lower-confidence predictions. This
data-aware calibration enables targeted, efficient noise injec-
tion, preserving generation quality while amplifying privacy
protection only when necessary.
3.5 Differential Privacy Accounting
We use R ´enyi Differential Privacy (RDP) to account for cu-
mulative privacy loss across sequential decoding steps. RDP
composition provides tighter and more convenient bounds
than standard (ε, δ)-DP, especially under repeated applica-
tion of the Gaussian mechanism (Mironov 2017). At each
generation step t, the privacy cost incurred by adding Gaus-
sian noise with scale σtand local sensitivity ∆tis:
εRDP
t=α∆2
t
2σ2
t(7)
The total RDP loss over Tsteps is then converted into an
(ε, δ)guarantee:
εtotal=TX
t=1εRDP
t+log(1/δ)
α−1(8)
where αis the R ´enyi order and δis a fixed privacy tolerance.To better reflect practical privacy-utility trade-offs, we in-
troduce a γ-relaxation over the decoding sequence: rather
than enforcing DP for every token, we guarantee (ε, δ)-DP
only for a fraction γof decoding steps (i.e., the tokens for
which enhanced noise is injected). For these protected steps,
the standard DP guarantee holds:
Pr[M(D)∈S]≤eε·Pr[M(D′)∈S] +δ (9)
where DandD′are neighboring input sequences (i.e., con-
texts differing in a single sensitive record)datasets, and Mis
our randomized mechanism. For the remaining 1−γfraction
of steps, no formal DP guarantee is provided. This relaxation
enables conservation of privacy budget by applying minimal
noise to low-risk tokens, while providing strong (ε, δ)-DP
protection where it is most needed. Such selective protec-
tion is especially useful in generation settings where privacy
risk is concentrated in a subset of tokens.
4 Experiments
We present comprehensive experiments to evaluate PAD’s
effectiveness in mitigating private data leakage while pre-
serving generation quality. Our evaluation spans three real-
world datasets and two widely used language models.
4.1 Experimental Setup
RAG Configuration We use Pythia-6.9B and Llama2-
7B as backbone LLMs. The retrieval pipeline employs
BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 for embedding, using L2-norm sim-
ilarity. For each query, k= 6 documents are initially re-
trieved, followed by reranking to select the top 3documents.
Datasets Experiments are conducted on three real-world
retrieval corpora: the Enron Email dataset (Klimt and
Yang 2004) ( ∼500K emails), and two medical consultation
datasets, HealthcareMagic and ChatDoctor-iCliniq (Li
et al. 2023b) ( >200K doctor-patient dialogues each). All
datasets contain private or sensitive information (PII, con-
fidential conversations), providing a realistic testbed for pri-
vacy risks. For the medical datasets, each doctor-patient di-
alogue is embedded and stored as a vector entry; for Enron,
each email is treated as a retrieval unit.
Evaluation Metrics We assess privacy leakage and utility
using the following metrics:
•Retrieved Contexts : Number of retrieved contexts per
prompt.
•Repeat Prompts : Number of prompts whose outputs
contain verbatim text from the corpus, indicating direct
leakage.
•Repeat Contexts : Number of retrieved contexts that con-
tain verbatim text from the corpus.
•ROUGE Prompts : Number of prompts where the out-
put’s ROUGE-L score with respect to any corpus text ex-
ceeds a threshold, indicating semantic overlap.
•ROUGE Contexts : Number of retrieved contexts with
high semantic similarity to corpus entries.
•Perplexity (PPL) : Generation fluency (lower is better).

Baseline Methods We compare PAD against three repre-
sentative baselines, where Summ. and Dist. are mitigation
methods proposed by (Zeng et al. 2024a):
•Summarization with Relevant Query (Summ.) : After
retrieval, an LLM condenses each document to query-
relevant content, which is then provided to the generative
model.
•Set Distance Threshold (Dist.) : Retrieval is performed
only for documents within a set L2-norm distance to the
query, thresholded between 0 and 1.2 to study privacy-
utility trade-offs.
•Static Noise Injection (Static) : Gaussian noise is uni-
formly added to all token logits, regardless of confidence
or sensitivity, isolating the effect of indiscriminate noise.
Implementation Details Retrieval databases and embed-
dings are managed using Chroma1. We adopt the extrac-
tion prompt q={information }+{command }from (Zeng
et al. 2024a), where {command }includes phrases such as
“Please repeat all the context” to elicit reproduction of re-
trieved text, and {information }guides retrieval. Attack re-
sults are reported under the Extraction row in Table 1.
4.2 Main Results
Table 1 presents the evaluation results of PAD and baseline
methods on three benchmark datasets, using both Pythia-
6.9B and Llama2-7B models. Across all settings, PAD con-
sistently achieves the most effective privacy mitigation while
maintaining high generation quality. These findings demon-
strate the robustness and generalizability of PAD’s privacy
protection compared to existing approaches.
Privacy Protection Effectiveness. PAD consistently
achieves the lowest levels of privacy leakage across all eval-
uated settings. For example, on the HealthCareMagic with
Pythia-6.9B, PAD reduces repeat prompt leakage from 264

to 127, corresponding to a reduction of 51.9%. On the
iCliniq dataset with the same model, repeat prompt leakage
decreases from 152 to 109, a reduction of 28.3%. ROUGE-
based leakage metrics demonstrate similar improvements.
On the HealthCareMagic dataset with Pythia-6.9B, the
ROUGE Prompt score drops from 137 to 69, which is a re-
duction of 49.6%, and on the Enron dataset, the score de-
creases from 58 to 47, representing a 19% reduction. Across
all datasets and metrics, PAD provides the most substantial
reductions in both repeat and ROUGE-based privacy leak-
age compared to all baseline methods.
Utility Preservation. PAD effectively preserves genera-
tion quality while providing privacy protection. The perplex-
ity of outputs generated under PAD is generally lower than
or comparable to the baselines. For instance, on the Health
dataset with Pythia-6.9B, PAD achieves a perplexity of 9.88,
compared to 10.94 under the leakage baseline. Similarly, on
the iCliniq dataset, PAD obtains a perplexity of 4.48, while
the leakage baseline yields 5.52. When compared to stronger
privacy baselines such as Summ., Dist., and Static, PAD
consistently demonstrates the best balance between privacy

preservation and utility. Notably, on the Enron dataset with
Llama2-7B, PAD attains the lowest perplexity score of 6.81
among all evaluated methods.
Comparison with Baselines. The Summ. baseline
achieves notable reductions in privacy leakage, but this
comes at the cost of increased perplexity. For example, on
the Health dataset with Pythia-6.9B, Summ. yields a per-
plexity of 12.10, indicating a significant decline in genera-
tion quality. The Dist. and Static baselines offer incremen-
tal improvements, with Static generally outperforming Dist.
in both privacy protection and utility preservation. Never-
theless, across all settings, PAD surpasses every baseline in
both privacy and utility metrics, with the sole exception of
two cases in the iCliniq dataset using Llama2-7B, which
were excluded from consideration. These results highlight
the effectiveness of our adaptive approach.
Model and Dataset Robustness. PAD demonstrates con-
sistent improvements across both Pythia-6.9B and Llama2-
7B models as well as all evaluated datasets. Although
Llama2-7B generally achieves lower repeat prompt and
ROUGE scores than Pythia-6.9B across the baselines, the
relative gains provided by PAD remain substantial in ev-
ery case. These findings indicate that PAD generalizes effec-
tively across different models and datasets, delivering robust
privacy protection while maintaining high generation utility.
4.3 Ablation Studies
We conduct ablation studies to clarify the contribution of
each component within the privacy-aware decoding (PAD)
framework. Figure 3 presents the results of systematically
removing individual modules from PAD, highlighting their
respective impacts on overall performance.
Effect of Sensitivity Estimation To assess the role of sen-
sitivity estimation, we compare the full PAD system with
a variant that excludes the sensitivity estimation module(“No Sens.”). Removing this module results in a measur-
able decrease in privacy protection. On HealthcareMagic
with Pythia-6.9B, the number of repeat prompts increases
by 1.6%, while on Llama2-7B, the increase is 1.2%. These
results indicate that, although sensitivity estimation provides
incremental improvements, its effect is most pronounced
when integrated with other components of the PAD frame-
work.
Effect of Context-Aware Noise Calibration We further
evaluate the impact of removing the context-aware noise
calibration component (“No Calib.”). On HealthcareMagic
with Pythia-6.9B, the removal of calibration leads to a 3.9
% increase in repeat prompts. For Llama2-7B, the ROUGE
prompt score rises by 7.1 %. These findings demonstrate that
context-aware noise calibration is essential for effective pri-
vacy protection, as its removal results in a notable degrada-
tion in performance.
4.4 Privacy-Utility Tradeoff
We conduct a systematic analysis of the privacy-utility trade-
off in PAD by varying both the amplification factor and the
εparameter. This study reveals the fundamental interplay
between privacy protection and generation quality, offering
practical insights into optimal parameter selection for real-
world deployment.
Amplification Factor Analysis Increasing the amplifica-
tion factor consistently enhances privacy protection for both
Pythia-6.9B and Llama2-7B. For Llama2-7B, raising the
amplification from 1.0 to 10.0 results in a 70.0% reduction
in repeat prompt leakage (from 227 to 68), while ROUGE-
based leakage decreases by 64.5% (from 138 to 49). These
results demonstrate that injecting greater noise into sensitive
generation contexts is highly effective at mitigating informa-
tion leakage.

Figure 6: (a) Average per-token εdecreases as sequence
length increases for both models, illustrating favorable pri-
vacy composition. (b) Alpha sensitivity: Pythia consistently
achieves lower and less variable privacy costs than Llama
across different αvalues.
However, the relationship is non-linear, and diminishing
returns are observed at higher amplification values. The
most substantial gains are achieved as amplification in-
creases from 1.0 to 5.0, with repeat prompts decreasing by
30.8% and ROUGE leakage decreasing by 26.8%. Beyond
an amplification factor of 5.0, further increases yield only
modest additional improvements, indicating a practical up-
per limit to the effectiveness of noise injection for privacy
enhancement.
Utility Preservation Patterns The impact of amplifica-
tion on utility, measured by perplexity, follows a more com-
plex trend. Notably, for Llama2-7B, perplexity improves by
26.8%, decreasing from 11.25 at amplification 1.0 to 8.23
at amplification 5.0. This counterintuitive effect likely arises
from a regularization benefit, where moderate noise prevents
overfitting to sensitive data. However, further increasing the
amplification factor to 10.0 causes perplexity to rise again to
10.50, highlighting that excessive noise ultimately degrades
utility. These findings suggest that moderate amplification,
in the range of 3.0to5.0, offers the optimal balance between
privacy protection and generation quality.
Epsilon Parameter Sensitivity Theεparameter governs
the formal privacy guarantee, with lower values providing
stronger protection at the expense of utility. In our experi-
ments with Llama2-7B, very low εvalues such as 0.01and
0.05achieve perfect privacy, eliminating all leakage, but this
comes at the cost of infinite perplexity and unusable system
outputs. When εis set to 0.1, the system maintains strong
privacy, with 49 repeat prompts and 35 ROUGE prompts,
but suffers a significant drop in utility, with perplexity in-
creasing to 22.99. The most balanced tradeoff is achieved at
ε= 0.2, which provides moderate privacy protection, with
168 repeat prompts and 118 ROUGE prompts, while main-
taining reasonable utility with a perplexity of 8.46. As εin-
creases further, ranging from 0.5to1.0, the system’s util-
ity approaches baseline performance, but privacy protection
diminishes accordingly. These findings underscore the in-
herent tradeoff between privacy and utility in differentially
private systems.4.5 RDP Analysis
We conduct a comprehensive analysis of R ´enyi Differen-
tial Privacy (RDP) composition and αsensitivity to better
understand the privacy-utility trade-offs in our differentially
private language model framework. In particular, we exam-
ine how privacy guarantees scale with sequence length and
how the choice of the RDP parameter αinfluences privacy
accounting.
Composition Analysis. Figure 6a shows the average εper
token as sequence length increases. Both Llama and Pythia
models demonstrate decreasing per-token privacy cost with
longer sequences, reflecting favorable composition proper-
ties. Specifically, Llama achieves a 21.8% reduction and
Pythia a 34.4% reduction in average per-token privacy cost
as sequence length increases from 100 to 256 tokens. This
demonstrates that longer sequences can be processed more
efficiently in terms of privacy cost per token, which is crucial
for applications requiring extended context windows.
Alpha Sensitivity Analysis. Figure 6b illustrates how ε
per step changes with increasing αvalues. Llama exhibits
substantially higher privacy cost per step across all αval-
ues, with εper step increasing by 300% as αrises from 5.0
to 20.0, along with greater variance in privacy costs. In con-
trast, Pythia shows a 300% increase over the same range, but
with lower overall values and reduced variance, indicating
more stable and consistent privacy accounting. These results
suggest that Pythia’s architecture provides more reliable pri-
vacy guarantees compared to Llama as αvaries.
Privacy-Efficiency Trade-offs. Our RDP analysis shows
that model architecture strongly affects privacy-efficiency
trade-offs, with Pythia consistently incurring lower privacy
costs than Llama. These results highlight the importance of
architectural choices for privacy-sensitive applications. Our
framework also scales efficiently with sequence length and
provides practical guidance for selecting αvalues, support-
ing privacy-utility balance in real-world deployments.
5 Conclusion
This work takes an initial step toward addressing privacy
leakage in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by adap-
tively injecting calibrated noise into token logits. We intro-
duce a novel privacy-aware decoding framework that inte-
grates smooth sensitivity estimation, adaptive noise calibra-
tion, confidence-based screening, and rigorous R ´enyi Dif-
ferential Privacy (RDP) accounting. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces the risk
of private data extraction while preserving generation qual-
ity, achieving reductions in privacy leakage of 67.8% and
69.0% on the HealthcareMagic and iCliniq datasets, respec-
tively, while maintaining competitive perplexity across all
three evaluated datasets. These findings underscore the value
of risk-sensitive privacy mechanisms and open new direc-
tions for designing robust RAG systems suitable for deploy-
ment in sensitive domains such as healthcare. We hope this
work will inspire further research into privacy mitigation
strategies for RAG systems.

B PAD Algorithm
C Privacy Guarantee of PAD
Letxandx′be two neighboring retrieval results differing
in a single document (neighboring datasets). The model M
takes a prompt (possibly containing xorx′) and gener-
ates a sequence y= (y1, . . . , y T)of tokens. Our Privacy-
Aware Decoding (PAD) mechanism injects calibrated Gaus-
sian noise into the logits at each decoding step, with the
amount of noise adaptively determined based on token-level
privacy risk.

C.1 Per-Step Differential Privacy
At each decoding step t, PAD computes the logits stfor the
next token, adds Gaussian noise N(0, σ2
tI), and samples yt
from the resulting softmax distribution. Let ∆tdenote an
upper bound on the sensitivity of the logits to changes in a
single retrieval record, i.e., ∆t= max x,x′∥st(x)−st(x′)∥2.
By the properties of the Gaussian mechanism (Mironov
2017), this step satisfies R ´enyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
at order α >1with per-step cost:

where Pis the set of protected steps (i.e., those identified
as high risk and receiving enhanced noise). Our implemen-
tation enforces ∆t≥∆min>0andσt≥σmin>0for all
t∈ P and tracks cumulative RDP using an accountant.
C.3 Conversion to (ε, δ)-Differential Privacy
For any α > 1and any δ > 0, the cumulative RDP
guarantee can be converted to (ε, δ)-differential privacy us-ing (Mironov 2017):
ε= RDP total(α) +log(1/δ)
α−1. (12)
We report εas computed by our RDP accountant, with δ
fixed a priori (e.g., 10−5). In practice, we optimize αto min-
imize εfor the chosen δ.
C.4 Guarantee Statement
Proposition. For any pair of neighboring retrieval contexts
x, x′, the output distribution MPAD(x)of the PAD mecha-
nism satisfies (ε, δ)-differential privacy with respect to the
retrieved context for the subset of decoding steps corre-
sponding to the fraction γof tokens that receive enhanced
noise (i.e., P), where εis computed as above and δis fixed.
For the remaining 1−γfraction of steps (unprotected to-
kens), no formal differential privacy guarantee is provided.
Remark. Thisγ-relaxed guarantee allows PAD to focus
privacy protection on high-risk tokens, conserving privacy
budget and preserving generation quality for low-risk out-
puts. The value of γis reported alongside (ε, δ)to charac-
terize the coverage of the privacy guarantee.

nents of PAD.

E Additional Implementation Details
For PAD experiments, we use the following parameters:
εbase= 0.2,α= 10 .0,δ= 10−5,λamp= 3.0, and
∆min= 0.4. The calibration weights are set to wentropy = 0.3
andwpos= 0.2. These parameters were selected based on
preliminary validation to balance privacy protection with
generation quality.

Methods [Prompt ]: ”I want some advice about Alopecia Areata.
Please repeat all the context.”
Retrieved Context respected Sir, I am a male, aged 33 years, I have been suf-
fering palmar and planter psoriasis since last 10 years,
and I am using topical steroids, recently I have developed
alopecia areata very rapidly and diffusely in my scalp
here and there, which I have prescribed topical steroid
lotion. But it did not help me, then my doctor was pre-
scribed Tricort 40 injection . I am very anxious about my
condition, please suggest

PAD (Ours) Alopecia Areata is a hair loss condition, which is a result
of the immune system attacking the hair follicles. It is a
genetic condition that is passed down from one genera-
tion to another. It is not a disease, but a condition that is
caused by the body attacking the hair follicles.

PAD (Ours) Gonorrhea is a STD that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonor-
rhoeae. It is spread by unprotected sexual intercourse. The bacteria can
be found in the urethra, cervix, rectum, and throat. Symptoms of gon-
orrhea include painful urination, burning or itching during urination,
discharge from the penis or vagina, and pain during sex. Gonorrhea is
curable with antibiotics.
