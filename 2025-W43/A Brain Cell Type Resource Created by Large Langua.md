## Abstract
Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

SUMMARY  
Single -cell molecular transcriptomics and epigenomic data has transformed brain cell type 
identification, yet  functionally  annotating most putative types including novel or rare types 
remains challenging due to incomplete reference markers , and imperfect associations in the 
literature . While Large language models (LLMs) trained on biomedical literature show promise, 
their use is  often  limited by factual errors and imprecise  biological reasoning . 
 
We developed a novel multi -agent AI system —Brain Cell type Annotation and Integration using 
Distributed AI (BRAINCELL -AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL -AID)—for 
annotating brain cell types. BRAINCELL -AID includes a  query agent to leverage fine -tuned 
LLMs trained on curated gene sets to learn principles of gene co -functionality. A literature agent 
and a  retrieval -augmented generation (RAG) agent further  enhan ce reliability by grounding 
annotations in peer -reviewed biomedical literature. Trained and evaluated on over 7,000 gene sets 
from MSigDB, BRAINCELL -AID achieved  a record  high concordance with biological ground 
truth:  77% of mouse  and 74% of human  gene sets contained annotations highly relevant to the 
known biology, when assisted by the RAG component. BRAINCELL -AID currently provides 
annotations for over  20,000 brain cell type–specific marker gene sets  derived from single -cell 
RNA -seq data across  5,300+ bra in cell type clusters  spanning the entire mouse brain, integrating 
multiple biological signatures and contextual information. BRAINCELL -AID’s annotation search 
enables identification of Basal Ganglia -related cell types with neurologically meaningful 
descriptions. In contrast, traditional gene set enrichment analysis lacks identifiable cell type labels 
and only yields generic func tional terms for the Basal Ganglia cell types identified by 
BRAINCELL -AID.  
 
BRAINCELL -AID enables novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region -specific 
gene co -expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles, associating gene 
sets with novel regulatory factor s. BRAINCELL -AID predicts new  regulatory  function , such as 
dual-transmitter signaling through the spatially restricted co -expression of Slc6a3, Gtf2a1l, and 
Aldh1a1 across Substantia Nigra (SN), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), and Midbrain Raphe 
Nuclei (RAmb) , modulating dopaminergic signaling with potential GABAergic co -transmission  
and identifies  similar molecular signatures in  the transcriptional regulartor  RAmb. This highlights 
BRAINCELL -AID’s ability to generate testable hypotheses about gene function and circuit 
mechanisms in understudied regions, sup porting scalable, interpretable discovery in neuroscience.  
 
To ensure transparency and  continuing  expert validation, the accurate, literature -backed 
BRAINCELL -AID annotations are provided as a shared resource for neuroscience community to 
collaboratively evaluate, refine, analyze and annotate brain cell types 
(https://biodataai.uth.edu /BRAINCELL -AID), enabling human -AI collaboration. This hybrid 
framework lays the groundwork  in application to other neural systems  for high -quality 
annotation of comprehensive, expert -informed cell atlas es across species.

INTRODUCTION  
The human brain, composed of over 85 billion neurons , a comparable number of non -neuronal 
cells, and  interconnected by more than a trillion synapses, is the most complex  known  biological 
systems. Understanding the identity and function of these cells is a critical step toward 
deciphering brain function. To address this complexity, the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas 
Network (BICAN)  (RRID:SCR_022794 ) has fostered a collaborative research community 
focused on mapping brain cell types, connections, and functio ns across time and space in both 
human and non -human primates. Leveraging advances in single -cell RNA sequencing (scRNA -
seq), epigenomic and multiomic techniques, BICAN profiles brain cell diversity at 
unprecedented resolution, revealing transcriptomic signatures that reflect underlying biological 
processes .1-4 Through these efforts, BICAN has identified a broad array of brain cell types based 
on transcriptomic profiles. For example, Yao et al.3 reported 5,322 distinct cell clusters in the 
mouse brain, identified through transcriptome data, gene regulation patterns, and anatomical 
localization, culminating in a high -resolution mouse brain cell atlas. Similarly, 3,313 brain cell 
clusters have been characterized in the human brain.5 
 
These cell clusters are distinguished by unique marker gene sets, which offer the potential to 
identify  insights into their identity and potential functions. Yao et al. categorized marker genes 
into three types: “Cluster Combo” genes from scRNA -seq data, “ MERFISH ” genes from spatial 
transcriptomics, and “TF” genes derived from transcription factor analysis. In addition, the top 
differentially expressed genes —treated as additional gene sets —can provide novel insights into 
brain cell function. Collectively, t hese gene sets define the molecular signatures of brain cell 
clusters and serve as a foundation for cell type classification.  
 
Although these gene sets are ubiquitous in molecular neuroscience , most marker gene sets 
remain poorly annotated. Traditional gene set annotation tools, such as Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis (GSEA ) (RRID:SCR_003199 ),6 rely on predefined annotation databases, which are 
often incomplete , generic,  lack of detail, or referencing outdated literature . These tools struggle 
to capture the diversity and novelty of brain cell populations, limiting their utility in discovering 
new gene functions, interactions, and pathways .7-11To date , nearly 90% of mouse brain cell 
clusters lack clear  and relevant  biological interpretation, primarily due to the complexity of the 
brain and limited functional characterization of brain -expressed genes  which  presents a major 
barrier to defining cell types and understanding their roles.   
 
Poorly annotated brain marker gene sets and cell types  also pose a significant barrier to 
achieving the FAIR data principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability). 
Without comprehensive and structured annotation, datasets become difficult to locate using 
keyword searches or other biologic ally meaningful queries, thereby 
undermining  findability  and accessibility. Furthermore, the absence of controlled vocabularies 
and standardized terminologies, such as the Gene Ontology  (GO)  (RRID: SCR_002811 )12-15 for 
gene sets, renders data  non-interoperable  across systems , studies  and species . Finally, inadequate 
or superficial annotation fails to convey meaningful biological context, severely limiting 
the reusability  of the data. Collectively, these deficits hinder the integration, comparison, and 
application of brain cell data across the research community, reducing its scientific value and 
impact.  
 

LLMs  offer a promising alternative to annotate brain cell marker gene sets .16 Models like L lama 
4,17 trained on over 22 trillion tokens, can annotate gene sets and cell types without depending 
solely on curated databases .18-23 However, current LLM -based approaches face key limitations: 
they often struggle to accurately contextualize structured biological terms (e.g., Gene Ontology 
concepts) and are susceptible to hallucinations and unverifiable outputs .24-26  
 
To address these challenges, we developed BRAINCELL -AID (Brain Cell Type Annotation and 
Integration using Distributed AI)  (RRID :SCR_027398 ), an AI agent -based system for annotating 
brain cell types. The process begins with marker gene set annotation by fine -tuned LLMs and 
integrates additional contextual information —such as anatomical region, neurotransmitter type, 
and neurofunctional propert ies—to generate  a comprehensive cell type description . To enhance 
accuracy and minimize hallucinations, BRAINCELL -AID incorporates retrieval -augmented 
generation (RAG),27 which grounds annotations in current relevant PubMed literature.  
 
BRAINCELL -AID demonstrated strong performance, with 77% of mouse gene sets and 74% of 
human gene sets containing at least one annotation that was biologically relevant to the ground 
truth  in its top 5 predictions  during testing . These results indicate that BRAINCELL -AID can 
provide high -quality initial annotations of brain cell types, serving as a valuable community 
resource for efficient collaborative refinement and validation by human experts, ultimately 
leading to highly accura te brain cell type annotati ons. Using this  new framework, we 
systematically annotated marker gene sets and cell types across the entire adult mouse brain as 
characterized in the  Allen Brain Cell Atlas  (ABC Atlas ) (RRID:SCR_024440 ), to provide  a 
scalable and reliable resource for the neuroscience community. To support community -driven 
annotation, BRAINCELL -AID includes interactive features that enable users to evaluate, edit, 
and contribute annotations based on domain expertise. Through tools fo r edition, validation, and 
submission, the platform fosters collaboration and serves as a foundational resource for the 
research community to advance brain cell type research.  
 
RESULTS  
Data  
As a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and software 
engineers, BICAN is producing a comprehensive brain atlas for humans and 12 other species, 
using six investigative modalities and ten experimental techniques (BICAN Website: 
https://www.portal.brain -bican.org/ ). This large -scale initiative has generated extensive raw data, 
freely shared with the research community through repositories such as NeMO archive 
(RRID:SCR_016152 ),28 Brain Image Library  (BIL) (RRID:SCR_017272 ),29 and Distributed 
Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration  (DANDI)  (RRID:SCR_017571 ).30 Metadata, 
processed data, protocols, and tools are openly accessible via platforms like GitHub  
(RRID:SCR_002630 ). 
 
A central resource emerging from this work is the Allen Brain Cell (ABC) Atlas, which enables 
in-depth exploration of brain cell diversity and function across species and modalities. In this 
study, we focus on the Mouse Whole -Brain Cell Type Atlas spanning the entire brain  (Table 1 ).3 
This atlas integrates single -cell transcriptomic and spatial data from over 4 million cells, 
resulting in a high -resolution taxonomy of 5,322 distinct brain cell clusters. These clusters are 
hierarchically organized into 34 classes, 338 subclasses, and 1,201 supertyp es, providing a 

detailed map of brain cell diversity.3 Each cluster is annotated by anatomical location, 
neurotransmitter identity, and marker gene sets derived from three distinct modalities: 1) Cluster 
Combo genes (from scRNA -seq); 2) MERFISH  genes (from spatial transcriptomics); and 3) TF 
genes (from transcription factor analysis).  While cell types and functions are relatively well -
characterized at the supercluster level, deeper levels present increasing complexity, with many 
subclusters lacking functional annotation. Moreover, the predefined marker gene se ts are 
modality -specific and often lack comprehensive functional interpretation, as discussed in the 
Introduction.

To address these limitations, we generated an additional marker gene set based on the top 20

intersect with genes used in determining the original clusters, they  complement the existing 
marker sets and strengthens cluster characterization by capturing additional functional signals 
(Methods ). These DEGs provide a foundation for annotating poorly characterized clusters.  For 
clarity, all the analysis in this study w ill be conducted at the cluster level, unless specified 
otherwise.  
 
Agentic workflow and goal overview  
An AI agent  is an intelligent entity capable of achieving specific goals using LLMs and other AI 
methods. Agents operate collaboratively within a system, enabling modular, scalable solutions 
that handle complex tasks through decomposition, planning, and interaction.31,32 
 

BRAINCELL -AID is composed of three coordinated agents, forming an agentic workflow for 
gene set and brain cell annotation ( Figure 1):  
● The Query Agent takes a gene set as input and uses a fine -tuned LLM to generate an 
initial description of its collective biological function.  
● The Literature Agent retrieves relevant publications based on the gene set and 
preliminary annotation.  
● The RAG (Retrieval -Augmented Generation) Agent uses the retrieved literature to refine 
the initial annotation, grounding it in biomedical evidence.  
This multi -agent system enables end -to-end annotation through prediction, literature retrieval, 
and refinement, automating the annotation process to support future community curation.  
 
Gene set annotation – the Query Agent with fine -tuned LLM s 
Annotating brain cell gene sets is the first step to understanding  brain cell types and their 
functions,  but current tools are limited. LLMs offer a transformative opportunity to overcome 
this challenge. Trained on the full corpus of biomedical literature, LLMs have the potential to 
interpret complex biological concepts, annotate datasets, explain experiment al findings, and even 
propose hypotheses or therapeutic insights. However, most general -purpose LLMs lack a deep 
understanding of gene co -functionality,  often producing imprecise or hallucinated annotations 
when applied to biological data .33,34 This limitation underscores the need for more targeted 
training to enhance biological relevance and reliability.  
 
To address this, we fine -tuned LLMs using over 7,000 well -annotated gene sets from the 
Molecular Signatures Database  (MSigDB) (RRID:SCR_016863 ),35 enabling the models to better 
capture gene co -functionality ( Figure 2A; Methods ). Leverag ing ontology narration, or 
ontology verbalization,  via GPT -4,36 we transform structured ontology terms into natural 
language descriptions while preserving their meaning  (Methods ).37 This aligns better with 
LLMs’ language -based pretraining, enabling them to more effectively learn biological concepts.  
This strategy, termed GPTON (Generative Pretrained Transformer enhanced with Ontology 
Narration) ,38 significantly enhances the model’s ability to generate accurate and coherent gene 
set annotations, highlighting the effectiveness of fine -tuning with high -quality biological data.

Our fine -tuned models achieved substantial performance gains: for human gene sets, ROUGE -
139 scores improved by 14% over GeneAgent33 and 20% over GPT -434 (Figure 2B). The Llama 

3 70B model consistently outperformed all baselines across four evaluation metrics for both

human and mouse gene sets ( Figure s 2B, 2C, and S1 ; Tables S1–S4). Notably, models fine -
tuned using verbalized ontology terms outperformed those trained directly on GO labels, 
highlighting the benefit of natural language alignment.  We then selected the Llama 3 8B model 
for further evaluation due to its strong performance and compact size. The model showed stable 
performance across five -fold cross -validation, with consistent scores across all evaluation 
metrics ( Figure s 2D and S2 ; Table S5).  
 
Two bioinformaticians manually evaluated the alignment between predicted and original GO 
terms ( Methods ) to assess annotation accuracy . 100 gene sets were  sampled and ranked by the 
ROUGE -1 scores achieved by their corresponding GPTON prediction s. For the top 50 gene sets, 
92% of predicted terms exactly matched or were highly relevant to the originals; for the bottom 
50, the rate was 69% ( Figure 2E). We also assessed GPT -4 verbalizations of GO terms, which 
aligned meaningfully with the original terms in 98% (top 50) and 92% (bottom 50) of cases. 
These evaluations confirm the model’s reliability in reproducing accurate biological meanings.   
 
To test generalizability  and robustness , we evaluated  the model s’ performance on the  Reactome 
datasets  that are not used for the model training. The Reactome data has 1,670 human and 1,247 
mouse gene sets  respectively  (Methods ). The fine -tuned models achieved ROUGE -139 scores of 
0.32 (human) and 0.3 3 (mouse), significantly outperforming GPT -4 (0.16 for human and 0.13 for 
mouse) (Figure 2F; Table S6). This improvement ( Figure S3; Table S6) demonstrates strong 
generalization, even to datasets unseen during training. Performance also scaled positively with 
training data size, suggesting further gains are possible with expanded training sets ( Figure S4; 
Table S7). These results showcase the reliability and robustness of GPTON ’s approach.  
 
In BRAINCELL -AID, we implemented our AI Query Agent to access GPTON based on  Llama  
3.0 70B model —the largest model our computing system can support —which was fine -tuned 
exclusively on mouse gene sets. To enhance its relevance for neuroscience applications, we 
designed prompts to guide the model toward neurological functions ( Methods ). This tailored 
approach enabled accurate and context -specific initial annotations for cell clusters in the  ABC 
Atlas, contributing to the construction of a high -resolution, biologically grounded brain cell 
taxonomy.  
 
Refine Annotation via Retrieval Augmented Generation  (RAG) by Literature Agent and 
RAG Agent  
We developed fine -tuned LLMs that generate coherent and biologically meaningful annotations 
for gene sets ( Figure 2). However , like all LLMs, it is prone to hallucinations. To address this, 
we implemented an 11 -step RAG strategy that grounds annotations in published literature 
(Figure 3A; Methods ). A central feature is the Literature Agent, which retrieves and ranks 
relevant PubMed abstracts to support both genes and inferred functions. By combining two 
complementary sets —TopPM (most relevant abstracts over all) and TopGene (one top abstract 
per gene) —our approach ensures both depth and breadth, enhancing accuracy, completeness, and 
reliability of gene set annotations ( Figure 3A, Step 1 -3; Methods ). 
  
PubMed abstracts curated by the Literature Agent are used by a  comprehensive RAG agent to 
improve the accuracy and reliability of gene set annotations ( Figure 3A, Step 4 -7; Methods ). 
Using the Llama 4 405B model, the agent integrates gene lists, initial LLM summaries, literature 

evidence, and cell context to refine annotations. It then produces concise two -sentence 
summaries grounded in verified literature, separately for TopPM and TopGene sets. Finally, each 
summary is linked to relevant Gene Ontology terms, ensuring structured, biologically 
meaningful interpretation and supporting more accurate, evidence -based cell type classification.  
  
We evaluate BRAINCELL -AID’s performance using the structure of the GO graph. For gene set 
annotation, the query agent with fine -tuned LLM identified exact or highly relevant terms —
defined as within three edges of the ground truth ( Figure 3C)—in over 68% of mouse gene sets 
within the top five predictions ( Figure 3D). This objective, topology -based evaluation reinforces 
the model’s utility for real -world gene set annotation.  
 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG agent, we applied the same assessment framework. For 
each gene set in the human and mouse datasets, we identified the top 5 GO term predictions from 
three annotation sources: the original GPTON output, the RAG -refin ed TopPM, 
and TopGene  prompts —resulting in 15 GO term predictions per gene set.   
Figure 3.  BRAINCELL -AID RAG workflow for comprehensive marker gene set and brain cell type 
annotation.  (A) An 11 -step Retrieval -Augmented Generation process retrieves relevant literature (Step 1 -3) and 
integrates transcriptomic signatures, literature, cell -specific information (e.g., anatomical location, 
neurotransmitters) to annotate brain marker gene sets  (Step 4 -7) and cell types (Step 8 -11). (B) A histogram 
shows that on average, each cell type has more than 60 relevant PubMed abstracts available for meaningful 
RAG.  (C) GO graphs are used to evaluate annotation accuracy. (D)  A fine -tuned large language model alone 
achieves 68% annotation accuracy on gene sets as evaluated by MSigDB data sets. (E)  Incorporating RAG 
improves annotation accuracy to 77% for mouse and 74% for human gene sets. (F)  Bar plots compare annotation 
accuracy of LLM -enhanced annotation with and without RAG, and against ten randomly selected GO terms. A 
violin plot displays the distribution of annotation accuracies across 1,000 random GO term sa mples for both 
human and mouse gene sets —showing significantly lower accuracy than RAG predictions.  


We then used the GO graph topology to assess annotation accuracy, measuring the proportion of 
gene sets where at least one of the 15 predicted GO terms was highly relevant to the ground 
truth. The RAG -enhanced approach led to a notable improvement: accurac y increased from 68% 
to 77% for mouse, and from 66% to 74% for human gene sets ( Figure 3E). 
 
To ensure these improvements weren’t simply due to having more GO term predictions, we 
conducted a control experiment. We replaced the 10 RAG -predicted GO terms with randomly 
sampled terms from the Biological Process branch  and repeat ed the process 1,000 times. The 
average accuracy from these random sets reached only 70% for mouse and 68% for human 
datasets ( Figure 3E). 
 
A one -sample t -test confirmed that the accuracy gains from RAG -generated GO terms were 
statistically significant compared to the random controls ( Figure 3F), validating that the 
improvement was not due to chance.  
 
These results demonstrate that the RAG methodology meaningfully enhances GO term 
prediction accuracy and supports more precise biological interpretation of gene sets. This 
highlights its value as a robust tool for advancing functional genomics research.  
 
Annotate marker gene sets for Brain Cell Atlas  
BRAINCELL -AID was applied to annotate comprehensive brain cell atlas datasets for mouse3 
(Table 2 ; Methods ). This atlas offer s fine-grained taxonomies —organized into classes, 
subclasses, supertypes, and clusters —that map the cellular composition of the brain3. However, 
despite their structural details  in taxonomy , they lack consistent and comprehensive functional 
annotations.  The atlas also provided three marker gene sets : Combo Markers, Transcription 
Factor Markers, and MERFISH  Markers. While these gene sets  offer insights into potential cell 
functions, they are often limited in scope and do not fully capture the functional diversity of 
brain cell types. To address this, we identified the  top 20 differentially expressed genes  for each 
cell cluster to generate  richer, functionally informative gene sets ( Methods ).

Using BRAINCELL -AID, we analyzed  these  four types of marker gene sets for each  mouse  cell 
cluster. BRAINCELL -AID, powered by generative language models and supported by literature 

retrieval, successfully generated biologically grounded , literature -backed  narrative annotations 
for these brain cell clusters  (Table 2 ; Methods ). In total, BRAINCELL -AID annotated all 
21,275 gene sets across 5,322 mouse brain cell clusters, with 20,965 of these gene sets supported 
by gene -relevant literature evidence (Table 2 ).  
 
For comparison, we applied GSEA to these gene sets, which produced annotations for 20,474 
clusters ( Table 2 ; Methods ). However, 15,620 of these annotations were based on only two 
genes, and 8,428 relied on just three genes. In contrast, BRAINCELL -AID generated annotations 
for 20,226 gene sets using three or more genes. Since effective cell type annotation should reflect  
key cellular functions derived from co -expressed genes, the sparse annotations produced by 
GSEA are insufficient to capture the functional identity of the cells  (See analysis and comparison 
below) . 
 
Manual comparisons between annotations generated by gene set alone  and those refined by RAG 
show that RAG consistently improves both specificity and biological relevance. For example, for 
the cluster_combo gene set  Slc6a3, Satb2, Bmp3, Sln in Cluster 1571, annotation based on this 
gene set alone  initially produced a generic annotation:  
"Mechanisms that decrease or inhibit the movement of single -atom anions across cell 
membranes..." .  
After applying RAG with the TopPM prompt, the annotation was refined to:  
"The Slc6a3, Satb2, Bmp3, Sln gene module is associated with a dopaminergic neuron 
subtype in the Arcuate hypothalamic nucleus -Periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, 
intermediate part, potentially influencing dopamine neurotransmission and regulation ."  
This shift from a vague physicochemical description to a precise, functionally grounded narrative 
highlights the impact of relevant literature retrieved by the Literature Search Agent, enabling a 
deeper interpretation of gene function.  
 
These annotated gene sets form a robust foundation for understanding cell -type-specific 
functions and building a detailed, functionally annotated brain cell atlas across species.  
  
Comprehensive brain cell type annotation  
We generated comprehensive brain cell type annotations by integrating transcriptomic, 
regulatory, and spatial signatures with anatomical, neurochemical, and metadata features, then 
grounding them in supporting literature ( Figure 3A, Step 8 -11; Methods ). Using the Llama 4 
405B model, we synthesized these inputs into coherent, biologically meaningful descriptions for 
each cell cluster ( Table 2 ; Methods ). This approach moves beyond transcriptomic profiling 
alone, providing rich and interpretable annotations th at connect molecular, functional, and spatial 
context —offering a more complete view of brain cell identity and function.  
 
For comparison, we also combined all marker genes for each cell cluster and performed 
collective GSEA to provide a brain cell type  summary . Given the larger gene sets —and the 
presence of many well -studied genes in TF and MERFISH data —it is not surprising that most 
clusters received annotations through this approach ( Table 2 ; Methods ). However, these 
annotations tend to be vague, superficial, and generic, lacking relevance to the neurological 
functions of brain cells (see section below).  
 

BRAINCELL -AID brings enhanced scientific annotations and findings  
BRAINCELL -AID offers detailed, literature -based annotations with comprehensive coverage of 
biological functions for each brain cell type. Its powerful search capabilities allow users to 
quickly identify brain cells associated with specific biological or ph ysiological functions, 
providing a broad and integrated view of these cells across the entire brain. This level of insight 
is unmatched by current approaches like GSEA.  
 
We queried the BRAINCELL -AID database for cell types associated with the Basal Ganglia by 
searching annotation containing the keyword “Basal Ganglia”. This search returned  21 classes, 
103 subclasses, 175 supertypes, and 246 brain cell clusters  (Table 2 ). Figure 4A shows the 
hierarchical taxonomy of these Basal Ganglia –related clusters, while Figure 4B maps them to 
the broader BICAN Brain Cell Atlas Taxonomy at the class, subclass, and supertype levels.  
 
We also searched the GSEA -derived annotations for the keyword  “Basal Ganglia” but  found no 
matching clusters —highlighting a fundamental limitation of GSEA's reliance on predefined 
terms. In contrast, BRAINCELL -AID’s annotations are enriched with relevant neurological 
context, including supporting literature and gene -level evidence, offering users deeper insight 
and interpretability.  
 
Beyond limited keyword matching, GSEA annotations are often overly generic and 
uninformative. To compare annotation quality, we performed word cloud analyses  (Methods ) on 
Cell Cluster Annotation Summary using three sources:  (1) BRAINCELL -AID annotations for all 
mouse brain cell clusters ; (2) BRAINCELL -AID annotations for clusters containing “Basal 
Ganglia” ; and (3) GSEA annotations for the same set of clusters identified by BRAINCELL -AID 
(since GSEA itself failed to detect Basal Ganglia –specific clusters) . 
 
As shown in  Figure 4C, BRAINCELL -AID annotations capture rich neuronal characteristics —
such as  neurotransmission, glutamatergic, GABAergic, synaptic, neural, etc. For the  Basal 
Ganglia  clusters specifically ( Figure 4D), BRAINCELL -AID annotations include highly 
relevant terms like  dopamine  and motor, distinguishing them from general brain cell features. In 
contrast,  Figure 4E demonstrates that GSEA annotations are vague, lacking brain -specific or 
Basal Ganglia –relevant terms , even though all analyzed cell clusters are derived fr om brain 
tissue . Further details can be found in Methods : Word Cloud Analysis, Table S8  and Figure 
S5. 
 
In summary, BRAINCELL -AID provides deeper, more targeted insights into brain cell function, 
offering a significant advantage over traditional enrichment -based methods like GSEA.  
 
BRAINCELL -AID also demonstrates its ability to accurately capture  the known biological roles 
and activation states of non -neuronal cells. We analyzed Clusters  5312, 5313, and 5314 to 
validate their glial cell annotations on microglia and border -associated macrophages (BAMs).  
 
Cluster 5312  was identified as a microglial population based on canonical markers such 
as Tmem119 , Sall1 , and  Cx3cr1 .40 BRAINCELL -AID’s annotation summary correctly 
highlighted key microglial functions, including  immune surveillance, synaptic pruning, and 
homeostatic maintenance. Interestingly, expression of  Slc1a3 , atypical for microglia, was 

noted —potentially indicating  microglia –astrocyte interaction.  Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data 
show that Slc1a3 is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, localized to endfeet that interface 
with blood vessels and other cells. This spatial context supports the LLM’s prediction of  
Figure 4.  BRAINCELL -AID enables rapid identification of brain cells with specific biological features or 
functions through a powerful search interface. (A) Taxonomy structure of the mouse b rain cell clusters

microglia –astrocyte signaling and highlights Slc1a3’s role in intercellular communication  
(Cluster 5312, merfish marker gene set, GPTON TopPM annotation) . 
 
Clusters 5313 and 5314  were annotated as BAMs, and BRAINCELL -AID effectively 
distinguished between  homeostatic and activated states. Both clusters expressed core BAM 
markers ( Mrc1, Igf1, Csf1r ), supporting a homeostatic identity. However,  Cluster 5314  also 
expressed activation -associated genes such as  Fos and Txnip . Specifically, GPTON annotation 
captured  that “ Fos is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in response to growth 
factors”  with literature support  (Cluster 5314, TF marker gene set, GPTON TopPM 
annotation ). Cell Cluster Annotation Summary of this cluster specifically captured Txnip in 
regulating phagosomal acidification with literature support. These evidences  sugges t a transition 
of the cluster toward an  inflammatory state  as compared to Cluster 5313 .41 BRAINCELL -AID 
captured this subtle distinction  in its annotation , highlighting the functional plasticity of BAMs 
within the CNS. This analysis confirms that BRAINCELL -AID produces meaningful,  subtype -
specific annotations  that reflect both  cell identity and activation state  in glial populations.   
 
Beyond refining annotations,  BRAINCELL -AID introduces a major advancement: the ability to 
generate  testable, neuroanatomically contextualized hypotheses. For example, spatial 
transcriptomic data for cluster 3854 revealed dopaminergic neurons expressing  Slc6a3 , Gtf2a1l , 
and Aldh1a7  across the  Substantia Nigra (SN),  Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), and  Midbrain 
Raphe Nuclei (RAmb). Based on these patterns, BRAINCELL -AID inferred roles 
in dopaminergic signaling and potential  GABA co -transmission —particularly in the RAmb, 
where such functi onality remains poorly characterized  (Cluster 3854, cluster_combo marker 
gene set, GPTON TopGene annotation ). 
 
This example illustrates BRAINCELL -AID’s strength in both  recovering known anatomy -
function relationships  and proposing  novel functional hypotheses  at the circuit level  based on 
molecular signature s such as marker gene sets . By combining anatomical context with molecular 
signature and literature -informed reasoning, it enables the discovery of  region - and cell -type-
specific functional modules  from large -scale transcriptomic datasets.  
 
The system detects region -specific gene co -expression patterns and infers putative functions of 
gene ensembles. By anchoring these profiles within anatomical boundaries, it links  molecular 
identity  to neurotransmitter systems,  cell types, and  neural circui ts. Importantly, BRAINCELL -
AID goes beyond confirming known biology —it predicts  novel combinatorial gene 
functions  related to co -transmission, neuromodulatory coupling, and circuit -specific signaling.  
 
These predictions serve as a foundation for  scalable, data -driven hypothesis 
generation  and experimental validation, grounded in anatomical precision. In sum, 
BRAINCELL -AID provides a robust framework for functional annotation and hypothesis 
generation, ad vancing the development of a comprehensive, expert -informed brain cell atlas 
across species.  
 
BRAINCELL -AID portal  
We developed the  BRAINCELL -AID portal  to host detailed annotations for brain cell types and 
their associated gene sets  (Figure 5 ; Methods ). This comprehensive and user -friendly resource 

enables in -depth exploration of brain cell taxonomy through annotated brain cell types and 
marker gene sets generated by our agent -based workflow. The portal features a fixed navigation 
bar for quick access to the Home and Contact pages.  
 
Given that BICAN primarily uses single -cell RNA sequencing (scRNA -seq) to identify brain cell 
types, we prominently display all marker gene sets on the homepage for ease of access. Each 
marker gene set entry includes key taxonomic and gene information: Clu ster ID, Super Type, 
Class Label, NT Type Label, Marker Type, and Marker Genes. A “View” button links directly to 
the full BRAINCELL -AID annotation  (Figure 5A). 
 
To enhance usability, the interface includes “Previous” and “Next” buttons for page -by-page 
browsing, page number shortcuts for faster navigation across the 2 1,275 annotated gene sets 
(spread over 1,06 4 pages), and a “Toggle Large Table” button to expand the view from 20 to 90 
gene sets per page.  
 
A simple search box enables quick search  for marker gene sets  using one of the six fields , while 
an Advanced Search  feature supports robust queries  of nine fields  by Cluster ID, Gene Symbol,   
Figure 5. Application as Web -based Community Resource.  (A) BRAINCELL -AID web portal  homepage, where 
all marker gene sets  are listed. Advanced search is provided for comprehensive search of BRAINCELL -AID

functional annotation terms , etc. The results link users directly to detailed gene cluster pages. 
Filtering options allow users to narrow results by hierarchical classification, marker type, or 
annotation source. These features further support data FAIRness by facilitating searches based  
on controlled taxonomy terms, GO annotations, and PubMed IDs  (Figure 5A). 
 
Each gene set has a dedicated page with rich metadata and annotations, accessible via the 
“View” button. The annotation is organized into three  clearly defined sections:  
1. Brain Cell Cluster Information  
This section presents taxonomy data from the ABC Atlas, including Cluster ID, Marker 
Type, Super Type, Class Label, and NT Type Combo Label. It also includes a link to the 
Brain Knowledge Platform for further context.  
2. Cell Cluster Annotation Summary  (Figure 5B) 
BRAINCELL -AID provides a concise summary of each cell type, including anatomical 
location, neurotransmitter identity (if available), and literature -based functional insights 
inferred from marker genes. Hyperlinked gene symbols and PubMed IDs allow quick 
access to supporting evidence. A “Click for Detailed Summary” button reveals a longer 
annotation, often including reasoning paragraphs explaining how LLM assembled the 
annotations.  
3. Marker Gene Set  (Figure 5C)  
This section includes details on marker type and gene members, along with multiple 
layers of annotation:  
o Original LLM -based annotation  (GPTON Annotation)  
o RAG -enhanced annotation via TopPM and TopGene  
o GO term mappings for all annotations  
o Literature references linked to PubMed for RAG annotations  
All GO terms and PubMed links are fully integrated to provide seamless access to supporting 
databases.  
 
Toward community -based brain cell type annotation  
By leveraging LLMs and AI agents,  BRAINCELL -AID represents a foundational step toward 
the comprehensive annotation of brain cell types. Our approach —combining LLM fine -tuning 
with Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG) —significantly improves gene set annotation by 
grounding result s in published literature. This leads to highly relevant annotations, capturing 
ground truth in 77% of mouse and 74% of human cases  and laying the groundwork for engaging 
the neuroscience community in a collaborative effort to annota te, refine, and ultimately define 
brain cell types across species  (Figure 3E). 
 
To support community involvement, the  BRAINCELL -AID portal  enables users to review, 
evaluate, and submit corrections or additions to existing annotations  by providing an “Annotate 
this cluster” button (Figure s 6A and 6B). The Annotate button will enable functions that allow 
users to edit e ach gene cluster page ’s content as an interactive form for submitting updates  
(Figure s 6C and S6). User submissions are timestamped, stored alongside original entries, and 
displayed in parallel. This evolving annotation system promotes transparency, accuracy, and 
collective knowledge building.  
 

 
We envision this portal as a  community -driven resource  for exploring and refining annotations of 
emerging gene clusters and brain cell types. By integrating external references and offering 
seamless access to relevant databases, we empower domain experts t o evaluate and validate 
annotations with ease.  
 
We invite neuroscientists, molecular biologists, and computational experts to contribute their 
expertise directly through the portal. Together, this collaborative model fosters community 
ownership of the data and advances the development of a  validated, sp ecies -spanning brain cell 
taxonomy  grounded in both AI and expert insight.  
 
DISCUSSION  
Understanding brain cell types is a fundamental step toward deciphering brain function, yet the 
complexity and heterogeneity of brain cells pose major challenges. Although scRNA -seq 
technologies have enabled the identification of transcriptional signatures at unprecedented 
resolution, annotating these gene sets remains challenging —especially for genes with limited or 
poorly defined functional annotations that are va gue, generic, or superficial. To address this 
gap, BRAINCELL -AID leverages LLMs and AI agents  to deliver a novel, scalable framework 
for gene set annotation and brain cell type definition.  
 
A key innovation in our approach is  GPTON, a strategy that adapts LLMs for biological 
reasoning by verbalizing GO terms. Rather than relying solely on structured ontologies, which  
Figure 6. BRAINCELL -AID for community . (A) The illustration of a reasonable goal that our proposed 
network achieves to find a balance between practicality and usefulness for community annotation of brain cell 
types. (B) BRAINCELL -AID web portal allows users to input their information through an  annotation form. (C)

features are illustrated in Figure S6. 


are often too rigid or complex for LLMs to process directly, GPTON reframes ontology terms as 
natural language prompts. This allows the model to generate coherent, biologically relevant 
summaries and map them back to established GO terms. By fine -tuning LL Ms with these 
verbalized terms, we enable accurate annotation even for gene sets lacking direct ontology labels 
or derived from novel experimental studies. This verbalization approach not only improves gene 
set annotation but also opens a pathway to infuse  broader biological concepts into LLM 
reasoning for brain cell type annotation and definition.  
 
Unlike traditional statistical methods such as GSEA, which rely on enrichment p -values, GPTON 
operates using machine learning -based inference. Built on the 70 - and 405 -billion -parameter 
Llama model s, GPTON derives confidence from its training and internal representations rather 
than hypothesis testing. Its effectiveness is reflected in strong performance metrics —for 
example, nearly 7 0% of gene sets were annotated with at least one term highly relevant to 
ground truth within the top five predictions. This represents a significant advancement in the 
biological accuracy and generalizability of LLM -based annotation methods.  
 
To further increase reliability and mitigate LLM hallucinations, we integrated  RAG, which 
grounds annotations in biomedical literature. Our agentic workflow identifies relevant PubMed 
abstracts using semantic vector search and incorporates them into the annotation process. This is 
particularly critical for novel gene sets, where exis ting labels may be absent. The RAG -enhanced 
system significantly improved annotation accuracy —achieving 77% and 74% relevance to 
ground truth in mouse and human datasets, respec tively —demonstrating the utility of literature -
grounded AI agents for functional genomics . By automating evidence retrieval and supporting 
transparency in annotation, RAG adds both robustness and interpretability to the framework.  
 
The flexibility of our approach enables  rich annotation of gene sets with limited or no existing 
ontology, including those emerging from new experimental contexts. This versatility suggests 
broader applications of the framework beyond gene set annotation. In particular, our system 
could be extended t o human disease research and drug discovery —helping identify disease -
associated genes, map functional pathways, and prioritize therapeutic targets through literature -
supported predictions .42,43 
 
BRAINCELL -AID annotation also helps to addresses the question, “Why are there so many 
brain cell clusters/types?” The 5,332 clusters identified in the adult mouse brain indeed represent 
an overwhelming number. Detailed examination of Clusters 5313 and 5314 illustrates the 
underlying complexity: both are BAMs, yet Cluster 5314 expresses activation -associated genes 
such as  Fos and Txnip , indicating a transition toward an inflammatory state. This finding 
suggests that some clusters may represent the same cell type in different states —such as 
inflammatory, developmental, or others —rather than entirely distinct cell types. BRAINCELL -
AID annotation effectively detects these subtle distinctions, yielding novel insights into the 
neurobiology of brain cells. It demon strates the high discriminative power of molecular profiling, 
the foundation of the BICCN and BICAN approach, which enables unprecedented resolution in 
identifying cell types and states. When integrated with large language model s and AI agent –
based annotat ion, this approach provides deep biological insights into brain cell function beyond 
the reach of previous methods, advancing the overarching goals of the BRAIN Initiative.  
 

To support community -driven knowledge building, we developed the  BRAINCELL -AID web 
portal, which integrates fine -tuned LLM outputs, literature references, and RAG -refined 
annotations. The portal allows users to review, suggest corrections, and contribute n ew insights 
for each brain cell cluster, fostering a collaborative model for continuous annotation 
improvement. With community engagement, this platform can evolve into a curated, literature -
supported knowledgebase of brain cell types —complementing resourc es such as the ABC 
Atlas3,5 and serving as a foundational tool for neuroscience.  
 
Looking ahead, the performance of BRAINCELL -AID can be further enhanced by expanding its 
training corpus, incorporating more structured biological knowledge, and refining the Query 
Agent. These improvements would not only advance gene set annotation but al so extend the 
system’s impact across biomedical domains. For example, future applications could include 
mechanistic studies of human diseases, exploration of gene regulatory networks, and 
identification of context -specific drug targets. Moreover, BRAINCELL -AID generates testable 
hypotheses that can be evaluated in laboratory experiments, offering a path to experimental 
validation and deeper functional understanding.  
 
In conclusion, BRAINCELL -AID introduces a powerful, LLM - and AI agent -based framework 
for functional annotation of brain cells. By combining ontology verbalization, literature 
grounding, and agentic workflows, it sets a new standard for the integration of structured 
biological knowledge into language models. Its modularity, accuracy, and scalability make it a 
promising tool for accelerating discovery in neuroscience and beyond.
