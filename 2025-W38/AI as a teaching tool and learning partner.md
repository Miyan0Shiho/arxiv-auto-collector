## Abstract
The arrival of AI tools and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs) has
had a transformative impact on teaching and learning and institutes are still
trying to determine how to integrate LLMs into education in constructive ways.
Here, we explore the adoption of LLM-based tools into two teaching programmes,
one undergraduate and one postgraduate. We provided to our classes (1) a
LLM-powered chatbot that had access to course materials by RAG and (2)
AI-generated audio-only podcasts for each week$\text{'}$s teaching material. At
the end of the semester, we surveyed the classes to gauge attitudes towards
these tools. The classes were small and from biological courses. The students
felt positive about AI generally and that AI tools made a positive impact on
teaching. Students found the LLM-powered chatbot easy and enjoyable to use and
felt that it enhanced their learning. The podcasts were less popular and only a
small proportion of the class listened weekly. The class as a whole was
indifferent to whether the podcasts should be used more widely across courses,
but those who listened enjoyed them and were in favour.

trying
 
to

how
 
to
 
integrate
 
LLMs
 
into
 
education
 
in
 
constructive
 
ways.
  
Here,
 
we
 
explore
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
LLM-based
 
tools
 
into
 
two
 
teaching
 
programmes,
 
one
 
undergraduate
 
and
 
one
 
postgraduate.
  
We
 
provided
 
to
 
our
 
classes
 
(1)
 
a
 
LLM-powered
 
chatbot
 
that
 
had
 
access
 
to
 
course
 
materials
 
by
 
RAG
 
and
 
(2)
 
AI-generated
 
audio-only
 
podcasts
 
for
 
each
 
week’s
 
teaching
 
material.
  
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
semester,
 
we
 
surveyed
 
the
 
classes
 
to
 
gauge
 
attitudes
 
towards
 
these
 
tools.
  
The
 
classes
 
were
 
small
 
and
 
from
 
biological
 
courses.
  
The
 
students
 
felt
 
positive
 
about

generally
 
and
 
that
 
AI

made
 
a

Students
 
found
 
the

chatbot
 
easy
 
and
 
enjoyable
 
to
 
use
 
and
 
felt
 
that
 
it
 
enhanced
 
their
 
learning.
  
The
 
podcasts
 
were
 
less
 
popular
 
and
 
only
 
a
 
small
 
proportion
 
of
 
the
 
class
 
listened
 
weekly.
 
The
 
class
 
as
 
a
 
whole
 
was
 
indifferent
 
to
 
whether
 
the
 
podcasts
 
should
 
be
 
used
 
more
 
widely
 
across
 
courses,
 
but
 
those
 
who
 
listened
 
enjoyed
 
them
 
and
 
were
 
in
 
favour.
   
 
 
 
Introduction
 
There
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
explosion
 
in
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
AI
 
tools
 
with
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
impact
 
on
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning.
  
Large
 
Language
 
Models
 
(LLMs)
 
have
 
facilitated
 
natural
 
language
 
interactions
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
simplifies
 
how
 
users
 
interact
 
with
 
swathes
 
of
 
data
 
and
 
knowledge.
  
The
 
most
 
well-known
 
AI
 
tools
 
based
 
on
 
LLMs
 
include
 
ChatGPT,
 
CoPilot,
 
Gemini,
 
Claude
 
and
 
Perplexity.AI,
 
and
 
these
 
services
 
generate
 
text
 
responses
 
statistically
 
based
 
on
 
large
 
volumes
 
of
 
training
 
text.
  
They
 
can
 
be
 
enhanced
 
with
 
new
 
text,
 
often
 
from
 
concurrent
 
web
 
searches,
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
relevance
 
and
 
factual
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
responses.
 
 
 
Much
 
of
 
the
 
narrative
 
around
 
AI
 
tools
 
has
 
been
 
negative,
 
focussing
 
on
 
plagiarism
 
in
 
assessment.
 
We
 
wanted
 
to
 
explore
 
their
 
positive
 
potential
 
and
 
evaluate
 
how
 
AI
 
tools
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
teaching
 
tools
 
and
 
learning
 
partners
 
by
 
students
 
in
 
the
 
Life
 
Sciences,
 
in
 
particular
 
determining
 
how
 
comfortable
 
students
 
felt
 
working
 
with
 
AI
 
tools.
 
 

 
Context
 
and
 
Background
 
 
LLMs
 
have
 
recently
 
been
 
suggested
 
as
 
tutors
 
and
 
learning
 
partners
 
(Grassucci
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025)
 
and
 
the
 
supplementation
 
of
 
LLMs
 
with
 
teaching
 
materials
 
has
 
been
 
considered
 
(Li
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025;
 
Shojaei
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025
).
 
Bespoke
 
mechanisms
 
for
 
soliciting
 
feedback
 
on
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
teaching
 
have
 
been
 
proposed
 
(
Fuligni
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025
).
  
We
 
aimed
 
to
 
introduce
 
an
 
AI
 
powered
 
chatbot
 
and
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
AI-powered
 
podcasts
 
into
 
BIO123
 
(BSc
 
Personalised
 
Medicine)
 
and
 
BIO711
 
(MSc
 
Biotechnology)
 
to
 
support
 
students
 
in
 
their
 
learning.
  
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
semester,
 
we
 
sought
 
feedback
 
from
 
the
 
class
 
to
 
evaluate
 
how
 
they
 
felt
 
about
 
using
 
the
 
AI-chatbot
 
and
 
podcasts
 
and
 
whether
 
they
 
felt
 
any
 
benefit.
  
To
 
implement
 
this
 
study,
 
we
 
enhanced
 
a
 
LLM
 
with
 
module
 
information
 
and
 
learning
 
materials,
 
including
 
the
 
module
 
handbook,
 
lecture
 
notes,
 
supplementary
 
reading,
 
assessment
 
guidelines
 
(but
 
not
 
assessments
 
themselves)
 
and
 
rubrics.
 
The
 
LLM
 
was
 
made
 
available
 
via
 
an
 
AI-powered
 
chatbot
 
to
 
class
 
members
 
who
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
ask
 
it
 
questions
 
about
 
anything
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
module
 
content
 
and
 
organisation.
 
The
 
chatbot
 
could
 
provide
 
alternative
 
explanations,
 
revision
 
timetables,
 
flashcards,
 
etc.
  
Example
 
use-cases
 
were
 
provided.
  
 
 
Module
 
materials
 
were
 
provided
 
to
 
the
 
LLM
 
by
 
Retrieval
 
Augmented
 
Generation,
 
a
 
process
 
that
 
ensured
 
they
 
were
 
not
 
incorporated
 
into
 
the
 
underlying
 
model
 
and
 
supported
 
factual
 
recall.
 
We
 
updated
 
the
 
LLM/chatbot
 
weekly
 
so
 
that
 
its
 
knowledge
 
base
 
grew
 
with
 
the
 
class.
  
AI-generated
 
podcasts
 
were
 
provided
 
that
 
contained
 
a
 
discussion
 
of
 
each
 
week’s
 
materials.
 
Both
 
reused
 
module
 
materials,
 
so
 
students
 
who
 
chose
 
not
 
to
 
participate
 
were
 
not
 
disadvantaged.
  
 
 
Key
 
Insights
 
or
 
Strategies
 
 
Students
 
are
 
embracing
 
AI
 
tools
 
From
 
a
 
cohort
 
of
 
41
 
students,
 
we
 
received
 
28
 
responses,
 
though
 
some
 
were
 
incomplete.
  
Agreement
 
with
 
the
 
statement
 
that
 
“I
 
feel
 
that
 
AI
 
tools
 
will
 
make
 
a
 
positive
 
or
 
negative
 
contribution
 
to
 
society”
 
with
 
1=very
 
negative,
 
5=very
 
positive,
 
scored
 
a
 
mean
 
of
 
4.0
 
(21
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1A).
  
In
 
an
 
agree/disagree
 
response,
 
75%
 
agreed
 
that
 
“I
 
do
 
regularly
 
use
 
any
 
AI
 
tools
 
outside
 
of
 
my
 
courses”
 
(16
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1B).
   
Students
 
felt
 
that
 
they
 
benefitted
 
from
 
using
 
these
 
tools.
  
100%
 
agreed
 
that
 
“I
 
do
 
feel
 
that
 
I
 
gained
 
from
 
using
 
the
 
AI-chatbots
 
and
 
AI-generated
 
podcasts”
 
(14
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1C).
 
 
However,
 
students
 
are
 
not
 
confident.
  
When
 
asked
 
how
 
they
 
would
 
rate
 
their
 
skills
 
with
 
AI
 
tools
 
(1=poor
 
and
 
5=high),
 
the
 
mean
 
score
 
was
 
3.2
 
(21
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1D).
 

 
Students
 
felt
 
positive
 
about
 
the
 
AI-powered
 
chatbot
 
 
Their
 
chatbot
 
experience
 
was
 
positive.
  
Agreement
 
with
 
“I
 
found
 
it
 
easy
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
AI-chatbot”,
 
scored
 
a
 
mean
 
of
 
4.1
 
(24
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1E).
  
Agreement
 
with
 
“I
 
enjoyed
 
using
 
the
 
AI-chatbot”,
 
scored
 
a
 
mean
 
of
 
4.2
 
(24
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1F).
 
 
100%
 
of
 
the
 
students
 
who
 
responded
 
agreed
 
that
 
“Using
 
the
 
AI-chatbot
 
enhanced
 
my
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
module
 
learning
 
content”
 
in
 
an
 
agree/disagree
 
response
 
(20
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1G).
  
 
 
AI-generated
 
podcasts
 
were
 
less
 
popular
 
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
respondents
 
used
 
the
 
podcasts
 
occasionally
 
or
 
never.
  
Few
 
students
 
listened
 
weekly
 
(25
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1H).
  
However,
 
amongst
 
those
 
who
 
used
 
the
 
podcasts,
 
opinion
 
was
 
positive.
  
For
 
respondents
 
who
 
listened
 
at
 
least
 
occasionally,
 
agreement
 
with
 
the
 
statement
 
“I
 
enjoyed
 
listening
 
to
 
the
 
AI-generated
 
podcast”
 
scored
 
a
 
mean
 
of
 
4.3
 
(15
 
responses,
 
Fig.
 
1I).
  
 
 
Whether
 
students
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
see
 
more
 
podcasts
 
was
 
mixed.
  
Amongst
 
all
 
responses,
 
agreement
 
with
 
“I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
see
 
AI-generated
 
podcasts
 
made
 
available
 
in
 
more
 
of
 
my
 
modules”
 
scored
 
a
 
mean
 
of
 
3.5
 
(22
 
responses,
 
not
 
shown).
  
However,
 
the
 
students
 
who
 
listened
 
at
 
least
 
occasionally,
 
agreed
 
with
 
a
 
mean
 
score
 
of
 
4.1
 
(15
 
responses,
 
not
 
shown).
 
 
Challenges
 
and
 
Solutions
 
 
The
 
specific
 
AI-chatbot
 
used
 
was
 
powered
 
by
 
Google
 
and
 
required
 
a
 
(free)
 
Google
 
account
 
to
 
gain
 
access.
  
Students
 
may
 
have
 
been
 
reluctant
 
to
 
register
 
or
 
share
 
their
 
Google
 
account
 
details
 
to
 
gain
 
access
 
and
 
this
 
may
 
explain
 
why
 
not
 
all
 
the
 
class
 
used
 
the
 
AI-chatbot.
  
However,
 
Google
 
is
 
currently
 
the
 
only
 
provider
 
of
 
tools
 
with
 
which
 
we
 
can
 
generate
 
the
 
chatbot
 
without
 
coding
 
it
 
directly,
 
making
 
it
 
an
 
efficient
 
solution.
  
The
 
AI-generated
 
podcasts
 
had
 
no
 
such
 
restrictions
 
and
 
were
 
provided
 
on
 
Blackboard
 
Learn
 
as
 
audio
 
files
 
in
 
.wav
 
format.
  
Whilst
 
they
 
could
 
be
 
listened
 
to
 
in
 
a
 
browser,
 
a
 
more
 
natural
 
setting
 
for
 
listening
 
to
 
podcasts
 
is
 
while
 
exercising
 
or
 
commuting
 
and
 
perhaps
 
the
 
steps
 
involved
 
in
 
downloading
 
and
 
transferring
 
the
 
podcasts
 
to
 
a
 
phone
 
or
 
audio
 
device
 
inhibited
 
their
 
wider
 
consumption.
 
 

The
 
modules
 
were
 
small,
 
but
 
chosen
 
due
 
to
 
our
 
roles
 
as
 
module
 
coordinators.
  
They
 
came
 
from
 
scientifically
 
advanced
 
Life
 
Science
 
courses
 
with
 
cohorts
 
we
 
would
 
ordinarily
 
expect
 
to
 
feel
 
positive
 
about
 
technology.
 
Whilst
 
these
 
cohorts
 
may
 
be
 
representative
 
of
 
science
 
and
 
technology
 
courses,
 
they
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
representative
 
of
 
the
 
wider
 
student
 
body.
   
 
 
Whilst
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
limited
 
study,
 
questions
 
about
 
how
 
we
 
integrate
 
AI
 
tools
 
into
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
must
 
be
 
addressed
 
and
 
this
 
exercise
 
has
 
provided
 
us
 
with
 
preliminary
 
data
 
about
 
student
 
attitudes
 
and
 
engagement.
 
 
 
Reflections
 
and
 
Future
 
Considerations
 
 
AI
 
is
 
exploding
 
into
 
our
 
working
 
lives
 
and
 
our
 
graduates
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
equipped
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
as
 
they
 
move
 
into
 
the
 
workforce.
  
At
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
the
 
potential
 
they
 
offer
 
to
 
improve
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning,
 
and
 
to
 
increase
 
efficiency
 
in
 
its
 
delivery,
 
will
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
HE
 
staff.
  
However,
 
presently
 
we
 
are
 
still
 
navigating
 
how
 
best
 
to
 
use
 
them.
  
 
 
These
 
tools
 
have
 
been
 
introduced
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
new
 
ways
 
to
 
access
 
knowledge
 
but,
 
paradoxically,
 
without
 
adequate
 
support
 
the
 
benefit
 
they
 
provide
 
to
 
HE
 
will
 
be
 
strongly
 
biased
 
towards
 
technologically
 
literate
 
students
 
and
 
modules
 
taught
 
by
 
technologically
 
literate
 
staff.
 
Barriers
 
to
 
their
 
adoption
 
for
 
staff
 
include
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
 
AI
 
can
 
be
 
harnessed,
 
limited
 
case
 
studies
 
of
 
its
 
use
 
in
 
education
 
and
 
technological
 
barriers
 
to
 
its
 
implementation.
  
These
 
barriers
 
are
 
also
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
felt
 
by
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
students.
 
 
AI
 
tools
 
will
 
allow
 
students
 
to
 
interact
 
in
 
new
 
ways
 
with
 
module
 
material
 
and
 
help
 
with
 
module
 
organisation.
 
They
 
will
 
act
 
as
 
a
 
personal
 
tutor
 
and
 
revision
 
partner,
 
generate
 
alternative
 
explanations
 
of
 
lecture
 
content,
 
create
 
revision
 
materials
 
and
 
revision
 
schedules,
 
and
 
generate
 
multimodal
 
learning
 
resources.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
AI
 
will
 
undoubtedly
 
become
 
embedded
 
in
 
our
 
future
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
infrastructure.
  
However,
 
questions
 
remain.
  
How
 
do
 
we
 
teach
 
practical
 
skills
 
to
 
students
 
in
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
AI-tools?
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
upskill
 
staff?
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
adapt
 
assessments
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
access
 
to
 
AI
 
doesn’t
 
impinge
 
on
 
evaluating
 
understanding?
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Our
 
conclusions
 
from
 
these
 
limited
 
cohorts
 
suggest
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
appetite
 
amongst
 
students
 
to
 
use
 
AI
 
tools
 
to
 
support
 
their
 
learning
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
are

Key
 
takeaways
 
●
 
Students
 
found
 
our
 
AI
 
powered
 
module-specific
 
chatbots
 
easy
 
and
 
enjoyable
 
to
 
use
 
and
 
unanimously
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
enhanced
 
their
 
learning.
  
 
●
 
Whilst
 
the
 
AI-powered
 
podcasts
 
were
 
not
 
as
 
popular,
 
they
 
were
 
also
 
valued
 
as
 
an
 
extra
 
modality
 
in
 
their
 
learning
 
when
 
adopted.
  
 
●
 
However,
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
confidence
 
in
 
AI
 
skills
 
suggests
 
that
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
class
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
supported
 
in
 
learning
 
how
 
best
 
to
 
use
 
these
 
tools.
