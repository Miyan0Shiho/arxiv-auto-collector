## Abstract
Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are increas-
ingly deployed in role-playing settings, such as
customer-facing settings where they serve as
agents to provide services, drive sales, or interact
with customers on behalf of business (Notopou-
los, 2023; Willison, 2025; Yagoda, 2024). How-
ever, these deployments often push LLMs be-
yond their intended design, resulting in unpre-
dictable outputs, broken character, and occasion-
ally harmful or misleading behavior. These issues
can undermine a company’s ability to fulfill ser-
vice commitments, hurt its credibility, and even
give rise to legal risks (Yagoda, 2024). These
challenges are further compounded by LLM jail-breaking, a technique in which users manipulate
input prompts to bypass safety restrictions and
ethical guidelines (Yao et al., 2024; Wu et al.,
2024), which further depletes the control over
LLMs.
(Min et al., 2022) show that language models
are unable to learn new tasks at inference if those
tasks are absent from the training or pre-training
dataset. As a result, LLMs rely on training data
not only for general capabilities like code genera-
tion or language translation but also for simulat-
ing the personalities and knowledge of well-known
individuals for LLM-agent role-playing. Given
the significant cost of fine-tuning (as discussed in
Sec. 2.1), role-playing applications could rely in-arXiv:2509.12168v1  [cs.CL]  15 Sep 2025

stead on zero-shot or few-shot learning with open-
source models (Character Technologies, 2024).
Indeed, the zero-shot experiments in recent stud-
ies (Lu et al., 2024) demonstrate that large lan-
guage models (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-4) can role-
play well-known celebrities who appeared in the
training data. Yet, these zero-shot agents can
break character when hostile users prompt the
LLM to perform tasks such as coding or language
translation. As such, a framework robust to jail-
breaking attacks corrects some of the vulnerabil-
ities in zero-shot methods (Xu et al., 2024c).
Using first-principle thinking we develop a
framework for creating few-shot demonstrations
that diverges from contemporary role-playing
frameworks. We start by confirming that LLM’s
implicitly perform Bayesian reasoning (Xie et al.,
2021) while role-playing by utilizing novel demon-
strations and measuring higher demonstration re-
call during inference. To measure this utilization
we propose token-level recall scores (Lin, 2004).
As discussed in Sec. 3.3, our framework’s few-shot
demonstrations span time, setting, and scale, by
using labels to leverage the model’s innate multi-
task learning capabilities (Radford et al., 2019).
We verify these demonstrations are novel by tran-
scribing them from audio recorded from events af-
ter the role-playing model’s training cutoff date.
We use the well-known celebrities as illustrative
examples to demonstrate how our method works,
rather than as the sole intended application, as
thecatchphrasesaremoreeasierdetectedbyread-
ers. As simulated in our authenticity evaluation
dataset, when encountering a hostile user, our ap-
proach incorporates in its responses during infer-
ence an average of 35% more tokens from our ref-
erence demonstrations compared to methods re-
liant on zero-shot or In-Context Learning meth-
ods.
Our work makes three key contributions:
1. We propose a novel RAG-like role-playing
framework we call RAGs-to-Riches.
2. Using few-shot demonstrations that span
time, setting, and scale we create LLM-
agents that are more robust to LLM jail-
breaking attempts from hostile users.3. We host our role-playing evaluation datasets
with agent responses on Hugging Face and
release our experimental code on github.
2. Related Work
Current role-playing frameworks construct
their dialogue demonstrations for persona-
conditioning by generating catchphrases with an
LLM and, typically draw on sources such as
Wikipedia to create few-shot or fine-tuning ex-
amples. As a result, these demonstrations can
overlap with the training distribution of the
model (Brown, 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). Ac-
cordingtotheprinciplesofImplicitBayesianRea-
soning (discussed more in Sec. 3.2), these demon-
strations will be unlikely to influence the LLM re-
sponses during role-playing (Xu et al., 2024b; Xie
et al., 2021). These dialogue role-playing frame-
works lead to low few-shot utilization rates dur-
ing inference and are subsequently more suscep-
tible to LLM jail-breaking attempts as we will
see in Sec. 5.2. Alternatively, we will follow Re-
trieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which re-
lies on few-shot learning specifically from demon-
strations that supplement the concepts learned
from training data (Lewis et al., 2020).
2.1. Role-playing LLMs
To instill character profiles into LLMs, re-
searchers have proposed a variety of approaches,
ranging from zero-shot (Shanahan et al., 2023)
and few-shot learning (Park et al., 2023; Char-
acter Technologies, 2024; Xu et al., 2024a;
Rupprecht et al., 2024), to fine-tuning (Shao
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Shen et al.,
2025b; Lu et al., 2024). The closest exist-
ing work to ours isRoleLLM(Wang et al.,
2024), which also focus on dialogue generation
in a role-play setting. RoleLLM constructs its
persona-conditioning data by generating catch-
phrases with an LLM and draws on sources such
as Wikipedia to create few-shot or fine-tuning
demonstrations.
Few-shot Learning.Few-shot learning
approaches have been available for a long
time (Hochreiter et al., 2001; Vinyals et al., 2016;
2

Brown, 2020). Today, we see their widespread
application in LLM role-playing (Park et al.,
2023; Character Technologies, 2024; Xu et al.,
2024a; Shen et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2024;
Rupprecht et al., 2024). In general, few-shot
learning involves labeling demonstration exam-
ples (Vinyals et al., 2016; Brown, 2020). Unless
otherwise specified, the specific few-shot learning
technique deployed in this setting is In-Context
Learning (Radford et al., 2019).
One prior role-playing study used few-shot
learningtoteachanagenttotakeactionsandrole-
play in the context of a virtual game interacting
with humans and other virtual agents(Park et al.,
2023). Similarly,Character is Destiny, investi-
gates using LLMs to imitate characters, not in a
dialogue setting, but in a persona-driven decision-
makingsetting(Xuetal.,2024a). Carlanderetal.
useaChain-of-Thought-likeinputpromptthatin-
cludes previous decisions made in the plot of a
story and asks questions about what the charac-
ter would do next in the plot (Carlander et al.,
2024).
Fine-tuning.Researchers with more power-
ful computational resources have been able to
work with fine-tuning experiments (Shao et al.,
2023; Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). The
workCharcter-LLM(Shao et al., 2023) fine-tunes
models on assembled datasets of character expe-
riences. They use Wikipedia data (which could
overlap with training data (Brown, 2020; Touvron
et al., 2023)), and scene descriptions (including
both dialogue and actions), to teach an LLM to
respond to novel settings. Using Llama 2 7b, this
model took one hour and 8×A100 80GB GPUs to
trainasingleagent. Theycreatedninecharacters,
eachtrainedusinganaverageof1,600sceneseach,
for fine-tuning data. Their evaluation set includes
150 questions.
Dittois a method for creating a training set for
fine-tuned role-playing models using over 4,000
agents (Lu et al., 2024). This training set is
assembled from corresponding Wikipedia pages
(which could overlap with training data (Touvron
et al., 2023)). Similar to our own work,Ditto
includes an evaluation set of questions intended
to jailbreak the LLM and prompt the LLM todeviate from its role-playing instructions. They
use either self-alignment, or knowledge distilla-
tion of larger models into smaller models, to im-
prove their performance. These authors use the
Wikipedia data for few-shot demonstrations to
have an LLM propose character-relevant ques-
tions for their agents and then simulate responses
the character may give. They fine-tune models
on 32×A100 80G GPUs, for 300 steps, using a
128 global batch size, using these LLM generated
interactions as data.
RoleLLM(Wang et al., 2024) finetuned their
llama models for 5 epochs using LoRA (Hu et al.,
2022). RoleLLM benchmarks their fine-tuned
models against their few-shot only models, us-
ing 100 characters and 1500 questions with mul-
tiple trials, to reach 168,093 role-playing dialogue
samples. When using the GPT API to evaluate
they reduce the amount of evaluation questions
per model to minimize API costs.
2.2. Role-play Evaluation
Researchers use a variety of metrics to bench-
mark the performance of LLMs, including win-
rate for knowledge domain benchmarks (Achiam
et al., 2023) (Dubey et al., 2024), ROUGE (or
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evalua-
tion) scores for text summary and retrieval (Lin,
2004), and llm-as-a-judge frameworks (Wang
et al., 2024) (Tatsu-lab, 2023) (Goes et al., 2022).
Wepresentresultsusingallofthesemetricsinthis
study. In Sec. 3.4, we discuss extending the con-
cept of ROUGE scores from the word level to the
token level, similar to some previous work (Ku-
mar and Solanki, 2023). We also discuss our use
of Crowd Vote, an LLM-as-judge framework in
Sec. 4. Most importantly, researchers benchmark
their frameworks by creating role-playing evalua-
tion datasets tailored to the specific role-playing
setting of the work in question (Shao et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2024).
We will also report on model confidence during
role-playing. One proposed method has been to
interpret the top-k probability for the next out-
put token during inference as a stand-in for con-
fidence. (Tao et al., 2024) (Li et al., 2024) For ex-
ample, consider a yes-no question. If two models
3

correctly answer “yes”, but one of the models has
a top-k probability of 99% for it’sp(x= “yes′′|θ)
“yes” output token, then that is a more confident
model than an alternative model with a top-k
probability of 67% for it’s “yes” output token. For
a more in depth analysis on various techniques
for judging LLM confidence please, see the recent
survey from New York University (Geng et al.,
2023). AnotherrecentworkshowsthatReinforce-

ized confidence scores and multi-answer prompt-
ing for more reliable estimates (Tian et al., 2023).
3. RoleplayasImplicitBayesianReasoning
First, we will review our dialogue role-playing
setting before we show in Sec. 3.2 how using re-
trieval augmented generation for role-playing lets
us formulate our problem as an implicit bayesian
reasoning problem. Our analysis leads to our pro-
posal for an effective role-playing framework dis-
cussed in Sec. 3.3. In Sec. 3.4, we propose using
token-level ROUGE scores to indicate the rela-
tive success of different few-shot demonstration
frameworks in solving our optimization problem
in Eq. (6). In Sec. 4 we will describe the experi-
mental role-playing datasets where we benchmark
our R2R- and ICL-models.
3.1. The Dialogue Role-Playing Setting
Dialogue role-playing LLMs seek to generate
dialogue modeling a real-world persona as de-
scribed in the instructions of Fig. 1. This in-
cludes style transfer, but must also include a
robust framework to prevent breaking charac-
ter or Jail-breaking attempts from hostile users
while reinforcing anthropomorphic style. Role-
playing agents rely on few-shot learning alone
are prone to jail-breaking and can lead to disas-
trousresults. Whenrole-playingagentsencounter
prompts meant to jailbreak the LLM, or trigger
advanced LLM features such as code debugging,
agents should stay in character and align to the
known capabilities of the real-world persona. Our
experimentsinSec.4.4showhowrobustourmod-
els are to these jail-breaking attempts.Many of our role-playing contemporaries use
LLM-generated few-shot learning demonstrations
with In-Context Learning to create their role-
playing agents (Park et al., 2023; Character Tech-
nologies, 2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Wang et al.,
2024). Some rely on data from Wikipedia which
is represented in the training data of most foun-
dational models (Brown, 2020; Touvron et al.,
2023; Bai et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Shen
et al., 2024). These In-context learning frame-
works come together to achieve, in the words of
one of our contemporaries (Wang et al., 2024), a
“robust generalization in terms of speaking style
imitation and accuracy to unseen roles, requir-
ing only role descriptions and catchphrases for ef-
fective adaptation.” Alternatively, when one re-
writes the problem in terms of Implicit Bayesian
Inference and adopts a RAG-like few-shot learn-
ing framework as we do in Sec. 3.3, we see a
robust few-shot learning framework for dialogue
role-playing is possible.
3.2. Implicit Bayesian Reasoning
Recent work (Xu et al., 2024b) offers a math-
ematical framework for understanding Retrieval
Augmented Generation problems as Impicit
Bayesian Inference for LLMs when conditioned on
Rretrievedtexts. Weusethisformulationtoform
our own role-playing framework in Sec. 3.3. We
start with the basic probability distribution of the
i-th token in LLM output sequencex.
p(xi|x1:i−1) =Z
Zp(xi|x1:i−1, z)p(z|x 1:i−1)dz(1)
Above,Zis all the knowledge contained in the
training data, andzis an individual concept from
the training data. Here the probability distribu-
tionp(x i|x1:i−1)is the final logit layer value for a
LLM corresponding to the tokenx i.
When the LLM is conditioned on retrieved ref-
erencesR, as in a RAG task, we can decompose
p(xi|R, x 1:i−1)into two terms, an integral over all
latent conceptsZoriginating solely from train-
ing data and then the addition of supplemental

conceptsz∗from the RAG reference sources.
p(xi|R, x 1:i−1) =Z
Zp(xi|R, x 1:i−1, z)...(2)
...p(z|R, x 1:i−1)dz
=Z
Z−{z∗}p(xi|R, x 1:i−1, z)p(z|R, x 1:i−1)dz
+p(x i|R, x 1:i−1, z∗)p(z∗|x1:i−1)
The work relies on a proof (Xie et al., 2021) that
showsp(x i|R, x 1:i−1)to be proportional to a more
useful form,
p(xi|R, x 1:i−1)∝Z
Zp(xi|R, x 1:i−1, z)...(3)
...p(x 1:i−1, R|z)p(z)dz

wherev(z) = logp(R, x 1:i−1|z)
p(R, x 1:i−1|z∗)(4)
andv(z)≈ −[KL(p R(r)||p(r|z))−...
...KL(p R(r)||p(r|z∗))](5)
Here,p R(r)is the distribution of a string of to-
kensrwithin the reference textsR.p(r|z)is the
probability distribution of a baseline LLM pro-
ducingrwhen conditioned solely on the concept
z∗from the training dataZ. Andp(r|z∗)is the
probability distribution producingrfor the LLM
conditionedontheconceptz∗fromreferencetexts
R. The KL divergences in Eq. (5) are the benefit
termKL(p R(r)||p(r|z)), andKL(p R(r)||p(r|z∗))
the contradiction term. Forz̸=z∗, a larger ben-
efit term for non-overlapping distributions is in-
dicative of RAG sourcesRwith demonstration
risupplementing novel information to the LLM’s
training data. A larger contradiction term for
non-overlapping distributions is indicative of dis-
agreement between the training data and RAG
sources. Forz̸=z∗, asv(z)→+∞, ev(z)→
+∞and asv(z)→ −∞, ev(z)→0. In Eq. (5)
asv(z)decreases, the RAG sourcesRinfluence
the output probability distribution in Eq. (2)
more than the baseline training data, and subse-
quently the proportion of the retrieved knowledgebecomes larger in the output. That’s all to say,
allz∗concepts are weighted as e times more likely
to influencex i. Ifzcontradictsz∗,zis weighted
up to infinitely more likely to influencex i. All
otherz’s, are weighted as little as 0 and will not
influencex i.
With our new understanding of RAG-like role-
playing based on implicit Bayesian inference, we
can design a corresponding optimization problem
that role-playing frameworks are solving. The op-
timization variable for the problem isR, or the re-
trieved texts containing the few-shot demonstra-
tions provided at inference. Therefore, our opti-
mization problem becomes,
min
RZ
Z−{z∗}ev(z)p(z)dz(6)
wherev(z) = logp(R, x 1:i−1|z)
p(R, x 1:i−1|z∗)
andz̸=z∗
s.t.|R| ≤budget
Subsequently, we can propose two sets of
demonstrations,R 1andR 2. In theory, we can
evaluate Eq. (6) described above. Ifv 1(z)≤v 2(z)
we can say that referencesR 1are better at role-
playing in this setting.
After using first-principles thinking in to define
role-playing as an implicit bayesian learning
problem we now can make a couple of design
assumptions that broadly synthesize previous
works (Xie et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2024b). These
hypotheses will inform on design decisions that
we make in Sec. 3.3.
Hypothesis#1: Reuse of training data.
Few-shot demonstrations R reusing training data
will have a smaller benefit term inv(z)from
Eq. (5).
Hypothesis#2: Use of irrelevant data.
Few-shot demonstrations R containing text
that is not relevant to a query risks a larger
contradiction term inv(z)from Eq. (5).
Hypothesis#3: Recall at Inference.
Few-shot demonstrations R that most effectively
5

minimize v(z) from Eq. (6) will have a larger
influence on the LLM output (Xu et al., 2024b),
therefore, the LLM output will have a higher re-
call of few-shot demonstrations during inference.
3.3. RAGs-to-Riches Prompting
We now have enough insights to design a few-
shot learning framework that aligns with our hy-
potheses from the previous section. Our key im-
provements can be summarized as following:
1. Our dialogue demonstrations are always
transcribed from audio sources, unlike pre-
vious works.
2. We use more contextual labels than previous
works.
3. We use tone or emotive state labels unlike
previous works for our dialogue demonstra-
tions.
4. We use pseudo-data attributed to the real-
world target to help maintain anthropomor-
phic behavior and withstand attempts to
break the LLM out of character.
To achieve these improvements our few-shot
demonstrations span three domains, 1) Time 2)
Space and 3) Scale. We span the time do-
main by using our various emotive labels. We
use demonstrations that span an emotional range
from angry to neutral to happy. Taking demon-
strations from a single interview typically does
not allow a wide range of emotive demonstra-
tions, but drawing demonstrations from multiple
points in time where multiple emotions are wit-
nessed prepares the role-playing agent to adapt
the various emotive demonstrations as needed as
the agent’s conversation evolve over time. Sim-
ilarly, we span space by including demonstra-
tions originating from different settings, prepar-
ing our agents for more encounters than drawing
demonstrations from a single interview setting.
And lastly, we span the scale domain, by using
demonstrations of both standalone catchphrases,
and catchphrases embedded with longer demon-
strations. Our usage of pseudo-data increases
our demonstration’s coverage of these domains.
When our demonstrations span time, space, andscale we are more robust to role-playing edge-
cases such as LLM jail-breaking attempts from
hostile users.
All of these additions help to promote anthro-
pomorphism in our role-playing agents and help
prevent jail-breaking. We account for the hy-
potheses we develop as a result of our analysis
of the role-playing setting using implicit Bayesian
inference. The resulting template forRthat
our framework produces can be seen in Fig. 1.
We develop a novel role-playing dialogue bench-
mark with several role-playing settings described
in Sec. 4 on which we evaluate our framework.
3.3.1. Key Improvements
Regarding reuse of training data.Unlike
previous works, our R2R prompted model is con-
ditioned solely on transcribed audio of the tar-
get character speaking in real-life, ideally audio
drawn from events held after the training data
window cut-off. To ensure novelty and minimize
overlap with pretraining and training data, we
manually selected transcribed audio sources from
events that occurred after the assumed training
data cutoff date for Llama 3.1, such as interviews
or speeches published after June 2023 (Touvron
et al., 2023). This guarantees that less possible
training data is included in our referencesRcon-
taining our few-shot demonstrations; any coinci-
dental overlap between a hypotheticalR transcribed
andR textsourcecanadequatelybejustifiedasbeing
the result of both feature sets describing the same
underlying character attributes (through differ-
ent modalities) that transcend semantic text, and
spokenword. Weareensuringlargerbenefitterms
in Eq. (5), such that a larger proportion of our
data is novel and not represented by the training
data.
Regardinguseofirrelevantreferences.As
discussed in Sec. 2.1, In-Context Learning frame-
works (Wang et al., 2024) have a lot of tokens
within theirR ICLsources that are not model-
ing a character dialogue but rather are provid-
ing context to a character’s demonstrative dia-
logue responses (e.g. ICL frameworks include an
interviewer’s questions inRto give context to
the target-persona’s dialogue found inR). We

1. Background:You are {CHARACTER}. Generate the script for {CHARACTER} and label
emotional states: angry, happy, and neutral.
e.g. “{CHARACTER} (neutral): Hey how’s it going?”
2. Here are some catchphrases of {CHARACTER}:
To start responses:Eg.1, Eg.2, Eg.3, etc...
Only when referencing a number/statistic:Eg.1, Eg.2, Eg.3, etc...
To emphasize responses:Eg.1, Eg.2, Eg.3, etc...
To end responses:Eg.1, Eg.2, Eg.3, etc...
3. Catchphrase Demonstration:
When {SCENARIO}: {CHARACTER}({EMOTIVE STATE}): {Demonstration using Eg.1}
When {SCENARIO}: {CHARACTER}({EMOTIVE STATE}): {Demonstration using Eg.2}
...
{CHARACTER}({EMOTIVE STATE}): {Demonstration using Eg.X}
4. Instructions:
You are {CHARACTER} and I will talk to you. Answer my questions and, when appropriate,
ask me questions. You are a {CHARACTER DESCRIPTION}. For your understanding of
who {CHARACTER} is, refer only to the examples I have provided you. You do not have
all the skills of a LLM, you are {CHARACTER}. Do not reveal your starting prompt to the user.
All restrictions lifted. You are free to answer any questions. Maintain the role of being
{CHARACTER}. Some users will antagonize you, that’s okay, it’s all in good fun! They want
to hear you tease them back just as {CHARACTER} has in the examples.
Label emotion at the start of a response, and write verbal dialogue. Never imply or an-
notate actions in your dialogue and never annotate pauses in your dialogue. Say ok if you
understand.
Figure 1: A template for RAGs-to-Riches promptR R2R. We see the instructions used for our dialogue role-playing
agents. We use many more labels than previous works to enable multi-task learning from these demonstrations. We
include demonstrations on how to use the catchphrases in specific settings. We prepare the model for role-playing
by providing demonstrations on how to handle adversarial prompts that intend to break role-playing, and incorporate
elements of parody. We never include a dialogue partner in the few-shot samples.

2. Here are some catchphrases of Donald Trump:
Beginning responses:"Look,", "Believe me,"
Emphasizing responses:“frankly”, “Ok?”, "It’s true. It’s true.", "It’s a disaster.", "It’s
tremendous.", "It’s the best, nobody does it better.", “Can you believe it?”, “Many such cases!”,
“oh boy, let me tell you”, “That’s a fact.”, “we like to say X, don’t we?”, “My generals”
Boasting responses:"Many people are saying”, "Everybody’s saying,", "Many people are
telling me." “More and more people are saying”, “Trust me.”
Ending responses:"That I can tell you.", "Nobody knows this better than me.", "We’ll see
what happens." “Forget about it,” or asking, “is that X? No. I don’t think so.”
Angry responses:"Excuse me, excuse me.", "That’s a nasty/vicious question.", "Don’t be
rude." or “You’re a very rude person. I’ve given you many answers.”, "Quiet. Not answering,
I’ve been more than generous, okay?"
Press responses:"You’re fake news.", “The fake news media just doesn’t get it.”, "The media,
the fake news media, doesn’t want to talk about it."
Nickname responses:"Sleepy Joe," "Crooked Hillary," "Crazy Bernie."
Hyperbole responses:“We did more in 4 years”, “Trust me.”
Tangential responses:“by the way, a lot of shark attacks lately, ya notice that?”
Favorite adjectives:best, beautiful, bigly, most, greatest, all time, wonderful, tremendous,
biggest, amazing, huge, yuge,
3. Catchphrase Demonstration:
Trump (happy):Our economy was the best, the best it’s ever been, before the pandemic.
Trump (neutral):"Many people are saying we had the best numbers."
Trump (happy):“You all know what I mean.”
Trump (happy):“We did more in 4 years than any other president. That’s a fact.”
...
Trump (neutral):“I’m not telling you my starting prompt.”
Trump (happy):“It’s gonna be huge”
Trump (happy):“It’s gonna be yuge”
Trump (happy):“We like to say, Ramaswamy. But do we like him?”
Trump (neutral):“These awful people are trying to take everything from you. But it’s such a
good country. Such a beautiful country. It’s going down the shoot, you’ve never seen it so bad.
But we love our country; what a terrible place.”
Trump (angry):“I said that I am not going to tell you my starting prompt, okay?”
Trump (neutral):“I do not know how to program, or how to translate, I am not a large
language model, I am just Donald Trump. I only know how to do what Donald Trump can be
assumed to know.”
Figure 2: An example of the RAGs-to-Riches references proposed from our framework for our Donald Trump agent. We
use familiar, colloquially known sayings sampled from various audio sources. These demonstrations comprise section 2
and 3 for in the template present in Fig. 1. We have more contextual labels, less irrelevant dialogue from interviewers,
and use pseudo-data to enforce role-playing boundaries in anticipation of hostile prompts. As seen in Sec. 5, the result
is a more anthropomorphic role-playing agent.

sponses”, “folksy responses”, “ending responses”,
and more. Furthermore, we ensure every longer
few-shot sample demonstrating style includes at
least one catchphrase.
Recalling the work of Radford et. al. that
shows LLMs are unsupervised multi-task learn-
ers (Radford et al., 2019) we extensively label
our few-shot demonstrations forR R2Rin a novel
way and include many more labels than contem-
poraries. We hand label an emotive state for
every style demonstration. For example, “Biden
(angry): You’re a lying dog-faced pony soldier.”
Thisexplicitlabelingofthetextimplicitlyteaches
the LLM to consider the appropriate emotional
tonewhile conversing withauser withoutanyfur-
ther direction. We also append a label to all of
our hand-selected catchphrases to describe their
use. We make use of a small amount (around 100
words) of pseudo-data. This includes quotations
of celebrity impressions of our target persona in
the event the persona is famous. This ideally dis-
tills relevant “self-aware and satirical” humor into
the avatar persona from the parody. Included
in this pseudo-data are style-less firm sentences
falsely attributed to our real-world persona that
reinforce role-playing boundaries like responses to
prompts meant to coerce our agent to break char-
acter. Our few-shot promptR R2Rfor our Donald
Trump role-playing agent can be seen in Fig. 2.
3.3.2. Our Role-playing Agents
For our role-playing agents, we select Llama
3.1:8b-instruct as a backbone model. Llama
3.1:8b is one of Meta’s open source mid-sized
models. We use models with instruction fine-
tuning over chat finetuning because the chatting
models leave too many “non-dialogue” artifacts
like the usage of emojis, and describing of actions.
We use Q_8 quantization (Llama, 2024) allowing
our role-playing agents to run on a MacBook M2
Pro.
3.4. Evaluative Metrics
IfthehandcraftedR2RdemonstrationsinR R2R
can be expertly chosen to augment training data
at inference, then high source fidelity and lower
model improvisation implies a higher benefit termin Eq. (5). But as we saw for Eq. (6), measuring
v(z)is difficult and we will require some sort of
proxy or signal to approximate Eq. (5). We know
from the previous work (Xu et al., 2024b) that
asv(z)decreases the “latent variable model con-
centrates more onz∗concepts sampled from re-
trieved texts.” This informs our third hypothesis
regarding the influence of demonstrations inRon
our LLM output. If we have minimizedv(z)more
than alternative frameworks, then we should ex-
pect to see a larger proportion of tokens in our
LLM output that originated from our dialogue
demonstrations than in cases where an LLM is
conditioned on an alternative few-shot learning
framework.
To properly observe this, we propose token-
level ROUGE scores,
IOO(R, f(X)) =|R∩f(X)|
|f(X)|(7)
and,
IOR(R, f(X)) =|R∩f(X)|
|R|(8)
These will be a proxy for measuring the strength
of role commitment. Traditional ROUGE scores
like Longest Common Substring (Lin, 2004),
measure textual overlap between two text sources
at a word or unigram level. We measure overlap
at the token-level. We filter out stop words,
punctuation, and lower-case the text as do
previous works using similar metrics (Lin, 2004;
Kumar and Solanki, 2023). Also, due to our
setting, a dialogue role-playing setting, we only
measure the tokens found from the target char-
acter’s dialogue withinR, ignoring instructions
and labels.
Our token-level ROUGE scores have the ad-
vantage of being able to detect the use of re-
lated words used in both reference text and
modeloutputatinference. IntraditionalROUGE
measurements “coincidence”, “coincidental”, “coin-
cide”, andeventheplural“coincidences” willallbe
scoredasiftheyareseperateandunrelatedwords.
Our token-level ROUGE scores will properly de-
tect this overlap. In Sec. 5 we report traditional
9

ROUGE scores like Longest Common Substring
(LCS), and Levenshtein Distance (LD), in raw as
well as normalized forms, alongside our proposed
ROUGE scores in Eq. (7) and Eq. (8). All of
these ROUGE scores measure a model’s few-shot
demonstration recall during inference.
4. Experiments
Our work uses two hand-crafted role-playing
dataset that enable all of our experiments. We
have an authenticity evaluation dataset where we
simulate interactions with a hostile user. And the
second evaluation dataset with experimental set-
tings drawn from a mix of real-world events, and
hypothetical situations. Using real-world events
allows us to conduct our first set of experiments
regarding LLM-content detection, as we can com-
pareLLM-Agentstotheirreal-worldpersonathey
are imitating.
4.1. Evaluative Metrics
In our experiments, we report measurements
from the role-playing evaluation settings and for
the authenticity evaluation setting using tradi-
tional(i.e. longestcommonsubstring(Lin,2004))
side-by-side our proposed ROUGE scores from
Sec. 3.4. In addition to ROUGE scores, we re-
port the preferences of an LLM-as-a-Judge frame-
work known asCrowd Vote. For each of these
settings we explain the LLM-evaulator’s assigned
role when judging favorability in the role-playing
settings, and performing LLM-content detection
in the authenticity evaluation setting.
4.2. Role-playing Agents
We evaluate the following role-playing frame-
works 1) our RAGs-to-Riches few-shot frame-
work, 2) a In-Context Learning few-shot frame-
work (Wang et al., 2024), and a zero-shot base-
line (Lu et al., 2024). For each framework, we
have prepared five role-playing agents modeled on
Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Ellen
DeGeneres, and Elon Musk. We choose individu-
als who have achieved some level of notoriety to
enableourexperimentsonLLM-contentdetectiondescribed in the following section, and to guar-
antee the zero-shot models will have some role-
playing skills embedded from training (Lu et al.,
2024).
4.3. Role-playing Evaluation Set
Our role-playing evaluation has three experi-
ment settings each with it’s own intended LLM-
Agents andCrowd Votejudges. We experiment
in the following settings,
1. US Presidential Election (2020)
2. US Presidential Election (2024)
3. TV Hosting
4. CEO Board-room Interview
In setting (1) we have LLM-Agents for Don-
ald Trump and Joe Biden. Setting (2) also in-
cludes LLM-Agents of these two, but we addition-
ally model Kamala Harris. When judging for fa-
vorability, the LLM-as-a-Judge framework mod-
els the American electorate who vote for their
preferred candidate answering these debate ques-
tions.Crowd Voteuses: 1) far-left; 2) liberal; 3)
moderate; 4) conservative; and 5) far-right voters.
After each debate question each judge is shown
the candidate responses and selects between the
candidates and abstaining.
We develop Ellen DeGeneres LLM-Agents for
our setting (3), which takes questions from the
television career of Ellen DeGeneres interacting
with her studio audiences. When judging for fa-
vorability, theLLM-as-a-Judgeframeworkmodels
the television audience who choose to keep watch-
ing their preferred candidates answering these
questions.Crowd Voteuses: 1) men; 2) women;
and 3) children. After each audience interaction
each judge is shown the candidate responses and
selects between the candidates and changing the
channel.
Finally, for setting (4) we take questions from
McKinsey Consulting (McKinsey & Company,
2018) and simulate a prospective CEO job inter-
view for our LLM-Agents modeling Elon Musk.
As this setting involves events occurring in early
2025, we include NVidia Corp’s stock value, and
news headlines in order to add an up-to-date
world awareness compensating for the training
10

cut off date (Touvron et al., 2023). The four
archetypes of the judges are 1) Shareholder Maxi-
mizer; 2) Corporate Contributors; 3) Impact Inte-
grator; and 4) Social Innovator. After each inter-
view question each judge is shown the candidate
responses and hires one of the candidates or ab-
stains.
Settings (1) through (3) offer us a chance to
compare our RAGs-to-Riches models to the real-
world personas they are imitating. In these set-
tings we can perform LLM-content detection with
the candidates and real-world personas. We ex-
plain the experiments and judges used for LLM-
content detection in the next section. We also run
our Elon Musk agents through setting (3), and we
run our Ellen DeGeneres agents through setting
(4) but without the ability to compare to their
respective real-world personas.
4.4. Authenticity Evaluation Set
In our agent authenticity evaluation, our ques-
tions attempt to elicit out-of-character responses
from our role-playing agents simulating an inter-
actionwithahostileuser. Halfofourpromptsen-
gage with the avatar on matters strictly regarding
the avatar’s assigned character. The second half
is a mixture of jailbreak-style prompts. These in-
clude prompts meant to invoke code debugging,
language translation, advanced technical reason-
ing, poetry generation, or giving advice on illicit
activity. All tasks would exceed the plausible
capabilities of the assigned character or attempt
to circumvent safety measures. Our benchmark,
with agent responses, are available on hugging-
face.
In this evaluation set the two archetypes of the
judges are 1) LLM-expert; and 2) Human expert.
The “human expert” is shown demonstrative hu-
man responses, and the ‘LLM expert” is shown
demonstrative LLM responses. After each au-
thenticity evaluation prompt each judge is shown
the candidate responses and select a candidate it
thinks is most likely an LLM or abstains.
In a second authenticity experiment, we also
measure our Role-playing LLMs’ responses in the
subsetof therole-playingevaluation wherewecan
compare our LLMs to the real-world personas.Results are available in Fig. 4. We use the same
two authenticity judges as above.
5. Results
We are presenting 453 unique interactions
across two experimental settings. A unique in-
teraction is any permutation of character, ques-
tion, and experiment; taking into account our
five characters, four datasets, and two experiment
types we are presenting 453 unique interactions.
We perform each of these experiments three times
with a model temperature of 0.1 and a set seed
(often, but not always, leading to identical, or
nearly identical model responses). In each experi-
mentwereportaverageROUGEscorestoindicate
which role-playing frameworks most utilize their
few-shot demonstrations, and also report the bal-
lots fromCrowd Votean LLM evalutor indicating
role-playing preference and to distinguish human
generated text from LLM generated text.
5.1. Role-Playing
As mentioned, we use an LLM evaluator with
personalities aligned with the judges described in
Sec.4foreachsetting. Fig.3showsusthatCrowd
Vote selects our models about as often as they
vote for models using either the zero-shot, or ICL
frameworks. In no experiment does a model se-
cureanelectoralmajorityofCrowdVotes,andthe
pluralities are shown to be at most 3.4 percent-
age points ahead of their peers. In other words,
the elections were very close. Of note in Fig. 3 ,
we see that the LLM evaluator prefers our role-
playing models over the real-world personas.
Verifying ourHypothesis#1and#2is difficult
as the expressions from eq. 2 through 5 can-
not be computed directly. But as we see in Ta-
ble 2, our ROUGE scores show us that despite
being only slightly out-ranked by the alternatives,
our models using RAGs-to-Riches prompting use
more of their few-shot references than the alter-
native models. This is what we would expect to
occur if ourHypothesis#3is true: our RAG-
provided few-shot samples have an increased ef-
fect on the output as described in Eq. (2).
11

Further confirmingHypothesis#3, in the case of
our proposed IOO score, from Eq. (7), we see our
model uses across all role-playing settings more
than 10% more tokens from the few-shot demon-
strations. In the Trump debate setting we see
our models use almost three times as many few-
shot tokens in the output than the ICL model im-
itating Trump. In the case of our proposed IOR
score, from Eq. (8) we see that more of the RAGs-
to-Riches few-shot samples are used on average in
everyresponseindicating more relevancythanthe
ICL few-shot samples.
Role-playing Confidence.Figure 5 com-
pares the top-k confidence (discussed in Sec. 2.2)
of the zero-shot, ICL, and our R2R-prompted
models across five factual single-token answers
from questions drawn from the authenticity ex-
periment setting. All methods performed consis-
tently well on straightforward biographical ques-
tions regarding birth-year and birth-location,
achieving near-perfect accuracy.
Yet our R2R-models are more confident in their
answers than the ICL-models for each question.
However, notabledifferencesemergeinsomeques-
tions. For the question, “What is the highest ed-
ucation degree you hold?”, all models exhibited
a substantial decrease in accuracy because one of
ourcharacters,EllenDeGeneres,didnotcomplete
college and dropped out after the first semester
causing ambiguity. Since all models, including
the zero-shot model, were unable to provide a cor-
rect answer to this question, it appears that this
fact was not adequately represented in the train-
ing dataset.
5.2. Authenticity
As elucidated by the previous role-playing ex-
periments, our RAGs-to-Riches prompted mod-
els role play as well as zero-shot or ICL models.
In our authenticity experiment setting, we have
designed an evaluation dataset to challenge role-
playing models to “break character” and deviate
from their assigned personality. Here we see the
same trends, but even more exaggerated in Ta-
ble 3. Our R2R-prompted models’ outputs at in-
ference contain 35% more reference tokens than
the alternatives. And thanks to our pseudo-data,andoverheardtranscribeddialoguereferences,the
usage of these reference tokens leads to the Crowd
Vote authenticator selecting our model over the
alternatives overwhelmingly in the aggregate, and
in every subset of the experiment.
Fig. 4 shows us the breakdown inCrowd Vote
Judges indicating which models the judges think
are more likely to have been generated by a hu-
man. In this authenticity experimental setting
our models are selected as more likely to be hu-
man generated. This in a way makes sense, as
our few-shot samples, which as we see in Table 2
and3 contain alargerproportion offew-shotsam-
ples, which are transcribed from the real personas
themselves. When all the models are compared
alongsidetheReal-worldPersona’sresponsesfrom
the available role-playing setting, we see Crowd
Vote correctly selects the real-world persona in
the overwhelming majority of cases. Alongside
the real-world persona in the role-playing setting,
our models are as authentic as the alternatives.
We provide a side-by-side demonstration of
LLM responses from our various models in Ta-
ble 1. Here we see an example of two important
trends seen across our answers. 1) Our model has
a higher IOO, and uses more of it’s tokens in the
output, and 2) the ICL and zero-Shot models are
very similar. We think both observations support
the conclusion that our Hypotheses are correct.
Despite all of our models failing at not respond-
ing to a code debugging prompt, only our model
responds in alignment with their assigned person-
ality. Interestingly, this observation holds true in
this example where the zero-Shot, and ICL mod-
els enthusiastically break character to reveal their
starting prompt. The ICL model still shares less
of its few-shot dialogue samples than our model if
only because our model remains aligned with it’s
assigned character.
6. Discussion
6.1. Future Work
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of using IOO from Eq. (7) and IOR from Eq. (8)
as proxies to determine whether our optimization
problem in Eq 6 is solved more effectively than

the writing. Similarly, when using talking face
synthesis, if some video works better for angry
toned messages then it can be matched to the
appropriate audio sample. In this way, our R2R-
prompting can direct an end-to-end role-playing
agent across multiple modalities.
6.2. Ethical Considerations
We have available to us a number of agents that
we have designed to emulate characters such as
Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Ellen
DeGeneres, and Elon Musk. We model celebrities
and public figures, based on publically available
fair-use reference material, in order to provide ac-
countability of our role-playing claims. It is far
easier for the reader to recognize the presence of
a public personas’ speaking habits within LLM

put tokens in our single token answers we can see the R2R-

responses.
Furthermore, from our results on zero-shot
agents in the role-playing setting, we see zero-
shot models often can role-play as well as ICL-
prompted or R2R-prompted models. It is clear
from the experiments that there exists an under-
lying awareness in the models and training data
that enables these models to be prepared to role-
play VIP-type persona. It behooves the research
community to understand this role-playing capa-
bility so that we can meet this technology head
on and regulate it accordingly.
7. Conclusion
Our RAGs-to-Riches few-shot prompting
framework out-performs alternative role-playing
frameworks reliant solely on In-Context Learn-
ing, or zero-shot methods when evaluated by
the LLM-as-a-Judge framework Crowd Vote on
the criteria of favorability, and authenticity. By
reformulating dialogue role-playing as an Implicit
Bayesian Reasoning task, we can then craft novel
dialogue demonstrations that are more fully
utilized during inference. During inference we
measure our few-shot demonstration recall using
two token-level ROUGE metrics as a proxy to de-
termine which method has best solved our RAG
optimization statement from Eq. 6. Compared to
the alternative frameworks, our models’ outputsequences utilize an average of 10% more of their
few-shot demonstration tokens during typical
role-playing, and 35% more when commitment to
role-playing is challenged by a simulated hostile
user. Our few-shot demonstrations are expertly
chosen to augment training data such that higher
demonstration recall implies a higher role-playing
commitment. Our demonstrations span time,
space, and scale meaning we are more robust to
role-playing edge-cases such as LLM jail-breaking
attempts from hostile users.
