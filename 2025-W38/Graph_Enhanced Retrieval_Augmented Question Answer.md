hybrid retrieval architectures. We then propose a new an-
swer synthesis algorithm that combines structured subgraphs

1 Introduction
Providing accurate and timely answers to customer inquiries is
critical for online retailers. The rise of conversational AI has
transformed customer service, with modern AI chatbots and
virtual assistants using large language models (LLMs) to sim-
ulate human-like support agents [23]. However, stand-alone
LLMs can hallucinate or lack up-to-date product details, lead-
ing to customer dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss [6].
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques address
this limitation by retrieving relevant documents or knowledge
at query time [1]. Traditional RAG approaches have shown
promise in various domains [18], but often treat support logs
as unstructured text, ignoring important relational context be-
tween issues or products. Recent developments in knowledge-
augmented generation have demonstrated the value of struc-
tured knowledge integration [20, 25].
The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with RAG has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving factual ground-ing [26]. Recent work shows that constructing a knowl-
edge graph over historical support tickets preserves intra-
issue structure and inter-issue relations, yielding large gains
in retrieval accuracy and answer quality [23]. In parallel, e-
commerce companies like Amazon and eBay leverage product
KGs for recommendations and search [12, 27]. Graph neural
networks have also been successfully applied to e-commerce
recommendation systems [8, 17].
Large language models such as GPT-3 and BLOOM have
made LLM-powered chatbots feasible [2]. However, unguided
LLMs can produce generic or incorrect responses. Integrat-
ing external knowledge, through knowledge graphs or text re-
trieval, improves grounding. For example, Chen et al. [23]
found that using structured knowledge for open-domain ques-
tions improved the correctness of responses in reading com-
prehension tasks. Similarly, the approach by Thorne et al. [22]
demonstrates how structured knowledge can be used for fact
verification, outperforming baseline methods on complex rea-
soning tasks. Other studies propose hybrid retrieval strategies
that draw on both textual and graph-structured sources [28].
Our contribution is to advance this line of work with a novel
answer synthesis algorithm: given a customer query, we re-
trieve both a structured subgraph of related products/entities
and relevant support documents, then jointly generate a re-
sponse that fuses information from both.
To accomplish this, we design a multi-stage system (Fig-
ure 1). In the offline phase, we construct a detailed knowl-
edge graph of products and past support issues. We integrate
data from vendor catalogs, user reviews, and solved tickets,
extracting entities (e.g., ”widget model X”, ”compatibility is-
sue”) and relations (e.g., product attributes, issue categories).
In the online phase, a customer query triggers two parallel re-
trievals: a subgraph of KG relevant to the query, and a set of
text documents from the support archive. Finally, our answer
synthesis module (Algorithm 1) feeds both types of informa-
tion to the LLM to produce a final answer.

2 Related Work
2.1 Evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion
RAG was introduced by Lewis et al. [1] to improve LLM QA
by retrieving grounding documents at inference time. Classic
RAG pipelines use vector (semantic) search over a text cor-
pus [4], which works well for many factual Q&A tasks but can
struggle with multi-hop or schema-rich queries [15].
Recent extensions have addressed these limitations through
various approaches. The work by Hamilton et al. [25] uses
graph neural networks to build better text representations,
showing substantial improvements for structured queries over
textual datasets. Multi-modal RAG systems have incorporated
visual and textual information for richer retrieval. Dense pas-
sage retrieval methods [4] and late interaction models [10]
have improved retrieval quality significantly.
Hybrid retrieval strategies that draw on both textual and
graph-structured sources have gained attention [28, 9]. The
integration of structured knowledge with neural retrieval has
shown promise in various domains including biomedical
QA [16] and fact verification [22].
2.2 Knowledge Graphs in Customer Service
and E-Commerce
Knowledge graphs are widely used in e-commerce for recom-
mendation and search [12]. They model products, categories,
and attributes as nodes, with rich relations capturing seman-
tic relationships [27]. Product KGs have been successfully
applied to enhance search relevance and personalized recom-
mendations [24].
In customer support contexts, KGs can represent solution
steps, issue taxonomies, and resolution patterns. Research has
shown that constructing KGs from past support issues, ex-
plicitly linking tickets, symptoms, and resolutions, can report
significant improvements in Mean Reciprocal Rank over text-
only baselines [28]. Similar approaches have been applied in
technical support and knowledge management systems [25].
For instance, Wang et al. [27] build a deep knowledge-aware
network linking items, features, and user preferences to en-
hance news recommendation. Such KGs can answer struc-
tured queries by graph traversal and have been successfully ap-
plied to product question-answering and knowledge retrieval
systems [24].
2.3 Multimodal and Hybrid Retrieval Systems
Modern retrieval systems increasingly combine multiple in-
formation sources and modalities. Hybrid approaches that
merge dense and sparse retrieval have demonstrated superior
performance across various benchmarks [25]. Hybrid RAG
frameworks introduce models for semi-structured sources, us-
ing multiple retrievers to handle queries requiring both struc-
tured and unstructured information.Recent advances in multimodal retrieval [7] have enabled
systems that can process text, images, and structured data si-
multaneously. Graph-augmented systems have shown particu-
lar promise in e-commerce applications where product infor-
mation spans multiple modalities.

answer synthesis.

3.1 Offline KG Construction
We build a domain-specific KG integrating products, features,
and support cases. The KG schema includes:
•Product entities: Individual items, models, categories
•Feature entities: Attributes, specifications, capabilities
•Issue entities: Problem types, symptoms, solutions
•Relations: ”has-feature”, ”compatible-with”, ”resolves”,
”similar-to”
Entity extraction and linking leverages named entity recog-
nition [3] combined with product catalog matching. We
employ transformer-based models fine-tuned on e-commerce
data [14] for high-precision entity recognition. Graph em-
beddings are learned using knowledge graph embedding tech-
niques [24] to enable efficient similarity-based retrieval.
3.2 Online Query Processing
Upon receiving a customer queryQ, our system performs:
Query Understanding: We apply entity recognition using
spaCy and intent classification with fine-tuned BERT mod-
els [19] to extract key entitiesE={e 1, e2, . . .}and classify
question intent.
Subgraph Retrieval: Using entitiesE, we retrieve relevant
subgraphsSthrough graph traversal with configurable depth
limits. We employ efficient graph querying using Neo4j with
Cypher patterns optimized for real-time performance.
Document Retrieval: Parallel text retrieval uses hybrid
search combining BM25 and dense retrieval with sentence
transformers [5], yielding ranked documentsDfrom support
archives.

Final Answer

parsed into entities, which retrieve both a KG subgraph (struc-
tured nodes/edges) and text documents. Both sources feed into
answer synthesis.3.3 Answer Synthesis Algorithm
Algorithm 1 details our core contribution: the joint synthesis
of structured and unstructured information.
Algorithm 1KG-Augmented Answer Synthesis
Require:QueryQ, Knowledge GraphG, Document IndexR
Ensure:Synthesized AnswerA
1:E←ExtractEntities(Q)
2:S← {}// Initialize subgraph collection
3:foreach entityeinEdo
4:s e←GetSubgraph(G, e,depth= 2)

8:facts←LinearizeSubgraphs(S)
9:context←ExtractRelevantParagraphs(D)
10:A←LLM.Generate(Q,facts,context)
11:returnA
The algorithm linearizes subgraphs into structured fact
statements, combines them with retrieved document context,
and uses an LLM to generate coherent responses that respect
both factual constraints and natural language flow.
Justification of Design:This hybrid synthesis approach im-
proves factual grounding by enforcing KG facts. The LLM
cannot readily alter structured triples it sees in text format, re-
ducing hallucination. At the same time, including document
excerpts prevents the answer from sounding too terse or dis-
joint.

4 Experimental Evaluation
4.1 Experimental Setup
We evaluate our system on a dataset of 10,000 customer sup-
port queries from a major e-commerce platform, covering
product inquiries, compatibility questions, and troubleshoot-
ing requests. The knowledge graph contains 50,000 product
entities and 2.3 million relations extracted from catalogs and
500,000 resolved support tickets.
Large Language Model Configuration:Our system
employsGPT-3.5-turbo(specifically gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) as
the primary language model for answer generation. The
model contains 175 billion parameters with training data cut-
off of September 2021. We configure the OpenAI API
with temperature=0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency,
max tokens=512 for response length control, and top p=0.9
for nucleus sampling.
The prompt engineering follows a structured template that
incorporates both KG facts and retrieved document context,
with specific instructions for factual grounding and natural
language generation. Each query receives structured facts
from the knowledge graph subgraph and contextual informa-
tion from retrieved support documents, ensuring comprehen-
sive information coverage.
Baselines: We compare against (1) Standard RAG with doc-
ument retrieval only, (2) LLM without retrieval, (3) KG-only
question answering, and (4) Hybrid retrieval combining dense
and sparse methods [25].
Metrics: Factual accuracy (verified against ground truth),
BLEU/ROUGE scores, response coherence (human evalua-
tion), and query processing time.
4.2 Results
Table 1 shows our method achieves significant improvements
across all metrics. The hybrid approach demonstrates 23%
better factual accuracy compared to document-only RAG,
while maintaining comparable response times.
Method Accuracy BLEU-4 Time (ms)
LLM Only 0.68 0.31 245
Standard RAG 0.74 0.42 1,230
KG Only 0.71 0.28 890
Hybrid Retrieval 0.78 0.45 1,850
Our Method 0.91 0.581,340
Table 1: Performance comparison showing our KG-
augmented RAG achieves superior accuracy and fluency with
reasonable latency.
4.3 User Study
Study Design and Methodology:We conducted a com-
prehensive user study with 50 experienced customer service
agents from three major e-commerce companies, each withover 2 years of experience in technical customer support. Par-
ticipants were randomly assigned to evaluate responses from
our system and baseline methods in a double-blind setup. Each
agent evaluated 100 randomly selected query-response pairs
across five categories: product compatibility, troubleshooting,
feature inquiries, warranty questions, and general product in-
formation.
Quantitative Results:Our system achieved 89% user sat-
isfaction compared to 67% for standard RAG (p¡0.001, paired
t-test). Agents rated responses on five dimensions using a
7-point Likert scale: factual accuracy (6.2 vs 4.8), response
completeness (6.0 vs 4.5), clarity (5.9 vs 4.7), relevance (6.1
vs 4.6), and overall helpfulness (6.0 vs 4.4). The statistical
significance was confirmed using Mann-Whitney U tests (all
p¡0.05).
Qualitative Insights:Participants particularly valued the
factual grounding provided by knowledge graph integration,
noting that our system’s responses contained fewer hallucina-
tions and more precise product specifications. Agents reported
34% reduction in time spent on manual fact-checking and 28%
improvement in first-contact resolution rates. Common feed-
back included appreciation for the system’s ability to provide
structured information while maintaining conversational natu-
ralness.
Comparative Analysis:When compared to hybrid re-
trieval baselines, our approach showed superior performance
in product-specific queries (92% vs 81% accuracy) while
maintaining competitive performance in general knowledge
tasks. The integration of structured product data proved par-
ticularly beneficial for compatibility and specification-related
inquiries.
5 Discussion and Future Work
Our KG-augmented RAG system balances accuracy with real-
time performance requirements. The parallel retrieval archi-
tecture enables sub-second response times suitable for inter-
active chat. Future work includes: (1) Dynamic KG updates
from new support cases, (2) Personalization using customer
purchase history, (3) Integration with voice interfaces, and (4)
Extension to multilingual support.
Deployment considerations include KG maintenance costs,
privacy implications of customer data integration, and scala-
bility to enterprise-level query volumes. Our approach pro-
vides a practical framework for enhancing customer support
with structured knowledge while maintaining conversational
naturalness.
6 Conclusion
We presented a novel framework integrating knowledge
graphs into retrieval-augmented generation for e-commerce
customer support. Our answer synthesis algorithm combines
structured subgraphs with retrieved documents to produce re-
sponses that are both factually grounded and conversation-
ally natural. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant
4

improvements in accuracy (23%) and user satisfaction (89%)
compared to existing approaches. This work contributes to the
growing literature on knowledge-augmented AI systems and
provides a practical solution for intelligent customer support.
