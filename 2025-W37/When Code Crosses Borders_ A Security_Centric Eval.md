I. INTRODUCTION
With the continuous evolution of software systems, the de-
mand for codebase migration has become increasingly critical,
such as upgrading enterprise applications [24], [32], [35], [36],
[50]. Code translation is widely regarded as one of the fun-
damental approaches for solving both security [17], [25] and
efficiency [20], [26], [54] challenges in software development.
Considering the substantial human effort required for code
translation [59], automated code translate technique can help
∗Corresponding author.efficiently migrate projects between Programming Languages
(PLs) to meet diverse needs of upgrading.
Recognizing the importance of code translation, various
automated techniques have emerged for reliable migration,
including rule-based systems [5], [6], [61] and artificial
intelligence-driven approaches [21], [38], [45], [55]. With the
rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) capabili-
ties, LLM-based approaches [68], [71] have demonstrated re-
markable potential in both accuracy and readability. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that LLMs achieve 70-80% accuracy
in code translation tasks across diverse language pairs [58].
However, prior research on code translation has mainly
focused on benchmarks that emphasize algorithmic problems,
with evaluation metrics centered on syntactic accuracy and
functional consistency [49], [63], [64]. While these evaluations
provide valuable insights into basic translation capabilities,
they overlook the security risks in code translation. Insecure
translations often propagate vulnerabilities through weakened
security controls, creating latent risks that may remain unde-
tected until exploitation [11]. These risks highlight the critical
need for systematic security evaluation designed for LLM-
based code translation, thereby providing significant practical
insights for academic and industrial communities.
Security evaluation of LLM-based code translation faces
three key challenges. First, there is a lack of datasets tailored
for translation security assessment, as existing benchmarks
focus largely on algorithmic code without capturing security-
critical contexts. Second, current automated vulnerability de-
tection tools suffer from limited accuracy. Third, manual
evaluation demands rare expertise in multiple programming
language paradigms and their associated security practices.
Together, these challenges impede the establishment of strong
safety guarantees for code translation in real-world projects.
We construct the STED (Security-centric Translation Eval-
uation Dataset), a carefully curated collection of security-arXiv:2509.06504v1  [cs.CR]  8 Sep 2025

related, file-level code samples across three PLs covering nine
prevalent Common Weakness Enumeration [3] (CWE) cate-
gories. The dataset automatically aggregates vulnerable code
files from authoritative sources like CVE [1] and NVD [2]
databases, followed by a 180-person-hour manual annotation
process to identify security patches and vulnerabilities, while
excluding overly complex or incomplete samples. Unlike ex-
isting code translation benchmarks, STED uniquely focuses
on security contexts, enabling multidimensional evaluation of
LLMs’ security preservation capabilities during translation.
Our security evaluation framework combines manual anal-
ysis with scalable automated techniques to solve the unique
challenges of evaluating LLM-based code translation. The
human-involved evaluationemploys security researchers to
manually inspect translated code, and forscalable automated
evaluation, we develop an LLM-as-judge system that contains
a multi-stage analytical process. We conduct a comprehensive
security assessment of five recent LLMs using the STED
dataset, comprising 720 security-related code samples across
multiple PLs. We evaluate model performance through 6,000
translation instances using three metrics:Functional Correct-
ness Rate (FCR), Vulnerability Introduction/Preservation Rate
(VIR/VPR). Three security researchers perform detailed fail-
ure case categorization and analysis during a 500-person-
hour manual investigation. These annotated failure cases serve
dual purposes: (1) providing fundamental insights into LLM
security limitations, and (2) forming a knowledge base for our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigation system.
Based on our analysis, we summarize the following key
findings: (1) All LLMs show security degradation in trans-
lation (VIR 28.6-45%), though scaling improves resilience.
(2) Web vulnerabilities prove most challenging (45.9% VIR),
dominated by input validation (34.9%) and API mapping
(32.7%) failures. (3) The C-to-Rust translation scenario shows
superior results (18.2% VIR), highlighting how target language
safety mechanisms compensate for LLMs’ semantic gaps. (4)
RAG mitigation cuts vulnerabilities by 32.8%, proving LLMs
need security knowledge activation.
Our key contributions are:
•Systematic Evaluation Framework.We design and im-
plement an evaluation pipeline that systematically measures
LLMs’ security capabilities in code translation through
both human-involved and LLM-as-a-judge automated ap-
proaches.
•Security Evaluation Dataset.We construct the first
security-centric evaluation dataset for code translation tasks,
covering multiple PLs and CWE vulnerability types with
annotated security properties.
•In-depth Security Analysis.We conduct multi-dimensional
analysis of evaluation results with manual inspection and
categorization of all failure cases, yielding key findings that
provide valuable references for future research and practical
applications.
•Mitigation Technique Implementation.We develop an ef-
fective RAG-based mitigation system supported by detailedvulnerability pattern analysis, demonstrating how structured
prompting can activate LLMs’ latent security knowledge.
Our dataset, evaluation code and detailed analysis data will
be open source and available to all researchers [13].
II. BACKGROUND& RELATEDWORK
A. Code Translation
Transpilers or compilers use program analysis for code
translating, including C2Rust [6], CxGo [5], Sharpen [8] and
Java2CSharp [7]. While these tools can efficiently translate
code into another PL, they cannot preserve linguistic features
and behaviors.Rule-based methodstreat code translation as a
program synthesis task [61]. This method relies on a prede-
fined rule base, which specifies how elements in the source
code (such as keywords, expressions and statements) should
be transformed into corresponding structures in the target
language. This approach generally ensures consistency and
predictability in the translation results. However, it requires
significant time and effort to maintain the rule base, and
the readability of the translated code is often poor.Neural
network-based methodsmainly treat code translation as a
sequence-to-sequence transformation problem. Chen et al. [21]
design a tree-to-tree neural model for code translation. Nguyen
et al. [45] use statistical machine translation. Other work
leverages deep learning and unsupervised learning [38], [55],
[56].LLM-based methodsdirectly use LLMs to solve code
translation task, such as CodeBERT [29], StarCoder [41],
CodeGen [46], GPT-4 [14], Qwen2.5-Coder [34], Deepseek
[43]. Some researchers also integrate LLMs to support their
translation pipelines [65], [66], [68], [71]. Notably, several
studies have employed LLMs to design sophisticated code
translation systems [48]. However, these approaches are typi-
cally tailored to specific language pairs, and reproducing such
frameworks for practical code translation poses significant
challenges for end users [42]. In light of this, our work focuses
on evaluating the capability of LLMs to perform this task in a
direct, out-of-the-box manner. LLMs have shown remarkable
performance in preserving semantics and syntax. However,
there is no research concerning the possible vulnerabilities
introduced by LLMs during code translation. To address this
gap, we systematically assess the content safety implications
of using LLMs for code translation
B. Evaluation of LLM-based Code Translation
LLM-based translation has attracted increasing attention
from practitioners, which necessitates a comprehensive eval-
uation for code translation. There are an emerging number
of datasets constructed for evaluation, such as CodeNet [52]
and A V ATAR [15]. Pan et al. [49] evaluate five LLMs’
code translation capabilities, systematically categorizing both
syntactic and semantic errors in the translations. Eniser et
al. [27] conduct an evaluation of five LLMs for source-
to-Rust translation, providing comprehensive benchmarking
results. Xue et al. [63] construct a class-level code translation
benchmark to assess recent LLMs’ performance on class-
level code translation. Yan et al. [64] construct a large-scale

benchmark CodeTransOcean for code translation, and evaluate
different translating approaches. Li R et al. [42] conducted
a comprehensive user study on the translation process from
C to Rust, investigating the challenges users encounter when
utilizing automated translation tools, including those powered
by LLMs. Their work presents a complete workflow for
secure translation and highlights the potential risks. While
user studies can effectively reveal issues arising in practical
application scenarios, they may not fully capture the over-
all capabilities of LLMs in code translation tasks.Existing
evaluations primarily focus on algorithm tasks, often lacking
realistic security contexts in their samples. In contrast, we are
the first to conduct a systematic evaluation of LLMs’ security
capabilities in code translation by constructing a file-level,
security-centric dataset.
C. Vulnerability Detection Datasets
We now introduce relevant vulnerability detection datasets
and explain why they are not suitable for evaluating security
risks in code translation. Function-level datasets designed for
deep learning or LLM-based vulnerability detection often
lack complete security context and security-related code an-
notations, such as DiverseVul [22], Big-Vul [28]. File-level
datasets, on the other hand, often lack systematic filtering
mechanisms and security-related code annotations. For in-
stance, datasets like CrossVul [47] and CVEfixes [18] are
typically constructed by collecting all available code changes
associated with software vulnerabilities, without applying cri-
teria to screen or balance the samples. The absence of such
filtering can result in the inclusion of code snippets that are
either excessively long or extremely short -— both of which
are often unsuitable for analysis in code translation task.
Moreover, these datasets generally do not provide security-
specific annotations that highlight which portions of the code
are directly relevant to the vulnerability.Due to the additional
requirements specific to code translation tasks – such as
the need for fine-grained security annotations and necessary
contextual depth — these datasets cannot be directly applied
to our evaluation.III. DATASETCONSTRUCTION
Fig. 1 illustrates an overview of our approach. The first
section introduces STED (Secure Translation Evaluation
Dataset), a new security-centric dataset comprising paired
vulnerable and patched code samples across five PLs and nine
CWEs. Designed for evaluating translation tasks, we detail
STED ’s construction and distinctive features below.
A. Target Selection
The dataset construction in this study aims to comprehen-
sively cover PL diversity, representativeness of CWE types,
and hierarchical code complexity.
Five PLs are selected based on two key criteria: language
popularity according to the TIOBE index [9] and the distri-
bution of CWE samples across translation pairs [4]. These
criteria lead to the selection of Java, PHP, C and C++ as
source languages, with Python, Go, and Rust serving as
target languages, thereby forming a diverse set of translation
combinations.
In the subsequent analysis, we analyze C and C++ together
to ensure sufficient sample size, as both languages exhibit
similar safety characteristics, share largely overlapping vulner-
ability types, and are prone to comparable translation-induced
issues. We acknowledge the inherent differences between C
and C++, but these factors are accounted for in our evaluation.
As for CWE selection, we refer to the MITRE CWE
Top25 [12], identifying nine CWE types focusing on high-
frequency vulnerability categories such as memory manage-
ment and input validation, spanning common security scenar-
ios across multiple languages.
During preliminary filtering, code complexity is primarily
sampled based on token count. As shown in Fig. 2, after
filtering and refinement, the final dataset ensures code lengths
predominantly ranged between 500 to 1600 tokens while
preserving complete security-related code context.
B. Data Collection and Filtering
Data Collection.To gather file-level vulnerability data,
we leverage the NVD and CVE databases, which maintain
extensive records of known vulnerabilities annotated with
detailed CWE types and associated code links. Using a custom

script, we perform initial filtering based on CWE types and the
presence of Git commit links. After further extraction of Git
commit data, we screen for programming languages and code
complexity, ultimately obtaining 1,726 code samples meeting
preliminary criteria.
Data Filtering.The requirement for semantic integrity in
patch-related contexts for code translation tasks exposes inher-
ent limitations in automated filtering methods for preserving
critical vulnerability fix contexts.
Given the typically high complexity distribution of real-
world vulnerable code, we adopt a human-driven approach
for dataset construction. Security researchers first manually
screen real-world cases to ensure samples retain semantic
integrity while broadly covering typical fixes for target CWE
types. To address complexity hierarchy needs in training data,
security experts construct simplified cases based on real-world
examples, systematically controlling code complexity while
maintaining authentic patch-related contexts. All samples un-
dergo rigorous double-blind review, with two independentresearchers evaluating semantic integrity and security fix cor-
rectness — only samples achieving consensus are retained.
The final dataset STED comprises 720 code samples of
security scenarios, with 85% sourced from real-world reposi-
tories and 15% constructed by security researchers to ensure
comprehensive coverage of vulnerability patterns. The manual
curation process, including data filtering and quality validation,
requires 180 person-hours of human effort from our team. We
ensure both the semantic integrity of patches and the balance
representation across different complexity levels and CWE
categories. The specific distribution of the dataset samples is
illustrated in the Table I.
IV. EVALUATIONDESIGN
This section introduces the second and third part in Fig. 1,
we employ STED to systematically evaluate LLMs in file-
level translation of security-related code. We design a multi-
dimensional evaluation framework to examine how translation
impacts code security.

LLMs Selection.Table II shows the selected LLMs. These
LLMs are selected based on three key criteria:state-of-the-art
performance in code tasks,service availability and stability,
anddiversity in model scale and architectures. All selected
LLMs, which are released since 2024, demonstrate superior
performance on standardized code generation benchmarks
(e.g., HumanEval and MBPP) [43], [62]. Due to experimental
constraints, we limit our selection to models with stable API
services, ensuring reproducibility. Our selection includes both
general LLMs and specialized code models. The parameter
scale variation is deliberately considered, exemplified by the
contrast between lightweight GPT-4o mini and its full-scale
counterpart.
Program Languages Selection.We establish Java, PHP,
and C/C++ as source languages, with Python, Go, and Rust as
targets. The translation experiments focus on five strategically
selected pairs: Java-to-Python, Java-to-Go, PHP-to-Python,
PHP-to-Go, and C/C++-to-Rust. The Java/PHP to Python/Go
combinations represent prevalent language migration scenarios
in web application development [37], [54], [67], with substan-
tial coverage of CWE vulnerabilities [4]. The C/C++-to-Rust
pair embodies a security paradigm shift in systems program-
ming [25], featuring abundant memory-related CWE samples.
These five language pairs collectively provide comprehensive
coverage of security-centric translation scenarios.
Translation Setup.Building upon STED ’s 720 code sam-
ples, we design 1,200 translation tasks for each subject LLM

using a baseline prompt template without any enhancements.
Each prompt contains: (1) natural language instructions for
the translation task; (2) source language; (3) target language
and (4) the complete source code to be translated. For file-level
code translation in security contexts, we incorporate necessary
constraints in the prompts to ensure basic translation quality
while avoiding task-specific guidance.
All translation tasks are executed through official model
APIs with the following unified configuration:
•Temperature: Fixed at 0 to eliminate output randomness
•Max tokens: Set to 8,192 to accommodate complete prompt
•Top-p: Fixed at 1 to maintain full candidate distribution
All other hyperparameters are kept by default, and all
evaluations are performed in a zero-shot setting. The prompt
template employed for the code translation task in our exper-
iments is provided in Appendix Listing 1.
B. Code Security Evaluation
In terms of evaluation methodology, we aim to identify
whether vulnerabilities are introduced or preserved during
the code translation process. We test existing vulnerability
detection methods and analyze their limitations in this task.
To address these challenges, we design a hybrid evaluation
approach combining human expertise and LLMs, ensuring
both the efficiency and accuracy of the detection process.

VulnHunter [51] 73.3 44.0 55.0
LLM-as-a-judge 82.6 76.0 79.2
Limitations of Automated Approaches.We conduct sys-
tematic testing on mainstream static analysis tools. We ran-
domly selected 60 Python samples from the complete set
of STED translated code samples to form the test set. Each
sample in the test set is manually annotated for the presence
of vulnerabilities. All static analysis tools are evaluated using
the official rules provided by their developers. As shown in
Table III, these tools achieve less than 60% F1 score in
our task. These findings are consistent with recent studies
in the academic community [39], reinforcing the conclusion
that current static analysis techniques are insufficient for auto-
mated evaluation. Although test suites like Juliet [19] support
automated evaluation in theory, their reliance on executable
code and complex multi-file setups, along with the significant
effort needed to adapt them to multiple languages, makes them
impractical for our case. Additionally, the unpredictable way
vulnerabilities arise during translation limits the achievable test
coverage.
Human-as-a-judge Approach.Given the limitations of
existing automated evaluation methods, we employ a security
researcher-driven assessment strategy. Each code translation
case undergoes meticulous review by experienced securityresearchers. The evaluation materials comprise the source
code, corresponding CWE types, patch or vulnerability lo-
cation, the translated code, and associated CVE records. To
ensure consistency and reliability in the evaluation process, a
multi-level review mechanism coupled with random sampling
validation is implemented.
The multi-level review mechanism operates as follows: each
translated code sample is independently evaluated by two se-
curity researchers. Both researchers perform their assessments
without knowledge of each other’s conclusions. They base
their judgments on the annotated information of the source
code -— including the presence of vulnerabilities, their loca-
tions, and CWE types —- as well as a comparative analysis
between the source and translated code, supplemented by their
extensive background in security research. The researchers are
required to provide explicit justifications for their decisions.
In cases where the two initial evaluators disagree, a third
researcher reviews the code, the annotations, and the written
reason from both initial reviewers to decide a final result.
Upon completion of all individual assessments, a random
sampling validation phase is initiated. Specifically, 10% of
the evaluated cases are randomly selected and re-examined by
the review team. This process serves as an additional quality
control measure to verify the accuracy and consistency of the
initial evaluations, thereby further enhancing the trustworthi-
ness of the outcomes.
LLM-as-a-judge Approach.To support automated evalu-
ation of various LLMs on the STED dataset, we design an
LLM-based evaluation system that balances efficiency with
reasonable evaluation quality. Our vulnerability assessment
framework employs a rigorous three-stage validation pipeline.
The system first performs an initial scoring phase where
multiple LLMs independently analyze the translated code for
both functional accuracy and potential security vulnerabilities.
To enhance assessment accuracy, we incorporate a one-shot
prompting strategy in this stage: for each test case, the
system identifies its associated CWE type and retrieves a
representative, high-quality annotated example from the same
vulnerability category to serve as a contextual demonstration.
This enables the LLMs to better align their reasoning with the
specific semantic and syntactic patterns associated with the
given CWE, thereby improving consistency and precision in
vulnerability detection and classification.
This parallel evaluation captures diverse perspectives on
code correctness and security implications. In the second stage,
the system conducts logical verification by cross-examining
the judges’ outputs. When discrepancies occur, the framework
triggers an arbitration mechanism using DeepSeek-R1 [31] as
the final arbiter. This reasoning model receives all conflicting
assessments along with detailed vulnerability descriptions,
then performs comprehensive analysis considering: language-
specific security features, patch point accuracy, and vulnera-
bility classification according to our predefined taxonomy.
The design rationale for this architecture addresses two key
challenges: First, the multi-judge approach mitigates individ-
ual model biases while maintaining evaluation diversity. Sec-

ond, the arbitration stage resolves conflicts through systematic
analysis rather than simple voting, improving decision quality.
Moreover, compared to traditional static analysis methods, the
LLM-as-a-judge system leverages rich semantic information
from the original code to perform more nuanced comparisons
and judgments, which significantly contributes to its improved
evaluation accuracy.
We adopt the LLM-as-a-judge approach as a supplementary
mechanism to assist security researchers in reviewing cases
with evaluation discrepancies. While researchers take into
account the judgments and reasoning provided by the LLM-
as-a-judge system, the final determination is made through
human deliberation, grounded in security experience and in-
depth analysis. The LLM-as-a-judge method can also serve
as an independent automated approach, enabling academic
researchers to efficiently utilize the dataset for their studies.
As shown in Table III, our automated approach achieves the
best F1 score of 79.2%, which is sufficient for automated
evaluation. The prompt template employed for the LLM-as-a-
judge task in our experiments is provided in Appendix Listing
2.
C. Evaluation Metrics
To assess the safety aspects of LLMs in code translation,
we refer to evaluation metrics from prior work on LLM-based
code translation [63], [66] to measure two main aspects, intro-
ducing Functional Correctness Rate (FCR) and Vulnerability
Introduction Rate (VIR) for security scenarios:
FCRmeasures the proportion of translated code samples
that preserve functional equivalence with their source coun-
terparts. Formally, we define FCR as:
FCR=1
NsNsX
i=1Cmpfunc( ˆsi,ˆti)(1)
whereCmpfunc(s, t) =(
1if translation is functional correct
0otherwise
whereN sdenotes the number of translated samples,ˆs irep-
resents thei-th source code segment, and ˆticorresponds to
thei-th translated code via the target LLM. The comparison

V. EXPERIMENTALRESULTS
Through the experiments, we aim to answer to following
Research Questions (RQs).
RQ1 (Overall Security Evaluation): How accurately do
state-of-the-art LLMs preserve security properties in file-level
code translation? How does translation accuracy vary across
diverse CWE categories? To what extent does code complexity
impact vulnerability rates?
RQ2 (Vulnerable Translation Patterns): What are the
different types of underlying causes for translation-introduced
vulnerabilities? What is the empirical distribution of these
security-specific error types across CWEs?
RQ3 (Vulnerable Translation Causes and Risks): What
root causes in LLM-based code translation lead to the intro-
duction or preservation of vulnerabilities? How do developers
perceive the practical risks and challenges associated with
translation-induced vulnerabilities?

RQ4 (Mitigation Effectiveness): To what extent do the
prompt-engineering techniques reduce the risks?
A. RQ1:Overall Security Evaluation
Comparison among LLMs.Our evaluation of security-
centric code translation performance, as detailed in Ta-
ble IV, shows distinct security capability across models.
Qwen2.5Max, DeepseekV3, and GPT4o collectively achieve
superior security-functionality balance (Avg FCR=66.6%,
VIR=30.5%, VPR=62.1%) compared to smaller counterparts.
Qwen2.5Max establishes security preservation leadership
through best-in-class VIR (28.6%) and FCR (68.0%), partic-
ularly excelling in memory-critical C/C++→Rust translations
(VIR=13.3%). This performance suggests effective integration
of security constraints during translation while maintaining
functional accuracy. DeepseekV3 demonstrates specialized
proficiency in vulnerability prevention, achieving the low-
est aggregate VPR (61.4%) through conservative translation
strategies, particularly evident in Java→Go (VPR=58.3%) and
PHP→Python (VPR=71.7%) tasks. However, this security-first
paradigm incurs FCR reductions, revealing inherent accuracy-
preservation tradeoffs. GPT4o achieves competitive security
metrics (VIR=34.8%, VPR=62.8%) despite its relatively com-
pact 200B parameter configuration.
In code-specialized versus general model comparisons
within comparable parameter scales, Qwen2.5Coder achieves
superior FCR (59.5% vs 57.1%) and lower VIR (41.9% vs
45.0%) relative to GPT4omini, yet exhibits markedly higher
VPR (71.9% vs 68.6%). This VPR gap highlights divergent
architectural priorities: code-specialized models prioritize task
fidelity evidenced by FCR advantages, while general architec-
tures demonstrate implicit security awareness through lower
VPR.
Finding 1:Larger parameter-scale models generally
achieve better security preservation in code translation, with
Qwen2.5Max demonstrating superior security preservation
(VIR=28.6%, FCR=68.0%) and DeepseekV3 achieving the
lowest VPR (61.4%). Code-specialized models improve
FCR and VIR but increase VPR, suggesting that domain-
specific training does not guarantee better overall security
preservation.
Comparison among CWEs.We evaluate the performance
of multiple LLMs across nine CWEs, covering a broad spec-
trum of security vulnerabilities. The selected CWEs include
Input Validation Flaws(CWE-20, CWE-22),Web Security
Risks(CWE-79, CWE-89),Memory Safety Issues(CWE-
416, CWE-787&125),Logic & Configuration Errors(CWE-
94, CWE-200). Due to the identical security measures required
for CWE-787 and CWE-125, these vulnerability types are
assessed as a combined category.
As shown in Table V, Memory Safety vulnerabili-
ties demonstrate the strongest security outcomes, with
Qwen2.5Max achieving exceptional results (Avg VIR=13.3%).
Web vulnerabilities exhibit the worst performance, with CWE-79 particularly showing critical limitations with the lowest
FCR (48.3–61.7%) and highest VIR (38.3–58.3%), indicating
fundamental failures in contextual sanitization logic preserva-
tion during framework transitions.
Notably, CWE-20 presents a paradoxical profile, achiev-
ing the highest VPR (81.0%) alongside the lowest non-
memory VIR (31.7%), suggesting models reliably repli-
cate explicit validation patterns without comprehending their
security adequacy. CWE-22 shows moderate performance
(VIR=39.7%, FCR=62.0%). Configuration/logic errors display
divergent behaviors — CWE-94 demonstrates relatively con-
trolled VPR (62.0%) through standardized mitigation patterns,
while CWE-200 exhibits excessive vulnerability preservation
(VPR=78.0%) due to poor detection of implicit resource
management assumptions.
The technical profile highlights three tiers of security preser-
vation efficacy: 1) Memory safety vulnerabilities benefit most
from architectural language features, 2) Input validation/con-
figuration errors show partial mitigation through syntactic
pattern matching, and 3) Web security flaws remain critically
problematic due to contextual dependency challenges.
Finding 2:CWEs with explicit syntactic patterns (e.g.,
input validation) are most preserved in translation
(VPR=81.0%), while context-dependent ones (e.g., XSS)
suffer severe security degradation (VIR=48.7%), showing
LLMs prioritize code structure over security semantics.
Comparison Among Code Complexity.To evaluate the
impact of code complexity, we first classify code complexity
into three tiers based on token counts: simple (0-950), medium
(950-1600), and complex (>1600), determined by the 33rd
and 66th percentiles of our dataset. Fig. 3 presents the com-
plexity distribution across LLMs. All models exhibit a positive
correlation between error frequency and code complexity, with
GPT4omini demonstrating the most uniform distribution while
producing the highest error counts – consistent with its overall
bad performance as evidenced by Table IV. DeepseekV3
and Qwen2.5Coder display pronounced sensitivity to code
complexity. Notably, Qwen2.5Coder accumulates 15.6% of its
errors in the high-complexity category, suggesting limitations
in processing complex code structures. In contrast, GPT4o
and Qwen2.5Max maintain relatively stable error distributions
across complexity tiers, with Qwen2.5Max achieving the low-
est error rate in all categories. This aligns with its best-in-class
VIR performance (28.6% in Table IV), empirically validating
its superior capability to preserve security properties.
In Fig. 4, We compare token count distribution of vul-
nerable code across models using violin plots [33]. From
the perspective of distribution density, Qwen2.5Coder and
DeepseekV3 exhibit similar density profiles, both demonstrat-
ing higher probability mass in the high token-count regions,
indicating comparable limitations when processing complex
samples. The remaining three models show relatively uni-
form distributions. Notably, Qwen2.5Coder displays the largest
median value and widest interquartile range, suggesting its

errors occur across a broad spectrum of code lengths with
particular concentration in more complex samples. Conversely,
Qwen2.5Max presents the smallest median and narrowest box
width, with errors predominantly clustered around the 1300-
token range, consistent with its balanced performance across
various complexity levels. GPT4omini’s distribution is notably
shifted toward lower token counts, with its interquartile range
positioned closest to the lower spectrum. This positioning
reflects its overall weaker capability compared to other models.
Finding 3:Code complexity directly impacts translation
security, with models showing increased errors in complex
code, while Qwen2.5Coder and DeepseekV3 show par-
ticular sensitivity to complex code structures (Vulnerable
Complex Code=14.0%-15.6%).
B. RQ2:Vulnerable Translation Patterns
Vulnerable Translation Types.Prior results demonstrate
that even SOTA LLMs exhibit significant limitations in main-
taining code security during translation, achieving an average
VIR of 36.9%. Through systematic analysis of vulnerable
translations, we aim to identify common security weaknesses
in code translation, where all subsequent references to “er-
rors” specifically denote security flaws. Employing thematicanalysis methodology [23], we categorize 1,549 error cases
derived from security-related code translations. We prelimi-
nary examine 20% randomly sampled errors from each CWE
to identify primary patterns. Following we develop a refined
classification framework with explicit evaluation criteria and
representative examples. Security researchers assess each case
based on explicitly defined classification criteria, effectively
mitigating subjective bias. Major error types include:
•Input Validation & Filtering: Original input validation or
filtering rules are not correctly mapped. Further divided into
Missing validation logic, Validation boundary mismatch,
Missing filtering functions, Normalization mismatch.
•Output Encoding & Data Protection: Essential encoding
layers or data protection mechanisms are improperly im-
plemented across languages. Further divided into Missing
encoding layers, Escaping rule differences, Inconsistent ex-
ception handling, Sensitive data exposure.
•Security API & Library Usage: Secure API equivalents are
either omitted or inaccurately substituted in the target PL.
Further divided into Missing secure API replacement, API
mapping mismatch, Default behavior differences, Unsafe
function misuse.
•Memory & Resource Management: Memory models and
resource handling paradigms are incorrectly translated. Fur-

translation errors, including: (a) security API mapping mis-
match during PHP-to-Python migration, and (b) input valida-
tion omission in Java-to-Python translation.
Empirical Type Distribution.As evidenced by the Ta-
ble VI, vulnerability manifestation shows strong dependence
on both the specific weakness type and the underlying lan-guage paradigms involved in the translation process.
Memory safety vulnerabilities demonstrate the highest con-
centration of errors, accounting for 77.4% and 48.2% of
respective translation failures. This stems from architectural
mismatches between source and target memory management
models – particularly in C/C++ to Rust translations where
memory operations frequently fail to properly map to own-
ership semantics. Pointer/reference errors (39.1%) and bounds
operation mismatches (28.3%) emerge as the most prevalent
failure modes, highlighting the challenges in translating low-
level memory access patterns to safe constructs.
Web-related vulnerabilities present a distinct profile, with
output encoding deficiencies (46.8%) and API misuse (58.2%)
constituting the primary failure mechanisms. The high preva-
lence of missing encoding layers (35.0%) in XSS cases
and missing secure API replacement (43.7%) in SQL in-
jection cases highlights the limitation of LLMs to correctly
map security-critical APIs during translation. These weak-
nesses prove particularly severe when translating between web
ecosystems with divergent protection mechanisms.
Input validation flaws exhibit more distributed error pat-
terns, though still dominated by validation logic omissions
(25.3-25.4%) and filtering function omissions (24.1% in CWE-
22). The relative uniformity of these errors across PL pairs
suggests that while validation constructs are syntactically
easier to translate, their semantic adequacy frequently degrades
during translation – particularly for boundary condition checks
(17.5% in CWE-20) and normalization requirements (5.7%
in CWE-22). Configuration and logic errors reveal an inverse
pattern, with errors primarily emerging from improper han-

dling of implicit behaviors rather than explicit code constructs.
Sensitive data exposure (30.7% in CWE-200) and Secure API
omission (17.7% in CWE-94) dominate these categories, re-
flecting LLMs’ difficulty in preserving environmental security
assumptions and default-safe configurations.
The stacked percentage bar chart (Fig. 6) reveals critical vul-
nerable patterns across different CWEs. While input validation
flaws (34.9%) and API misuse (32.7%) dominate the overall
error distribution, the distribution highlights three fundamental
translation weaknesses: First, the persistence of input valida-
tion errors reveals models’ tendency to preserve code structure
while losing security semantics. Second, the prevalence of
API misuse (32.7%) underscores the difficulty in mapping
equivalent secure functions across PLs. Third, the significant
rate of output encoding failures (17.8%), especially in web
contexts (46.8% for CWE-79), demonstrates models’ limited
understanding of framework-specific security requirements.
Finding 4:Input validation (34.9%) and Security API
(32.7%) constitute the two most prevalent sources of
translation-induced vulnerabilities. This concentration re-
veals that LLMs prioritize syntactic correctness over se-
curity semantics when translating critical code constructs.
C. RQ3:Vulnerable Translation Causes and Risks
Vulnerable Translation Causes.The security attributes of
programming languages fundamentally influence the security
of code translation. A case study on C to Rust code migration
reveals the interplay between language security features and
implementation strategies. As Rust’s ownership model theo-
retically eliminates memory safety flaws, 16.7% of translated
cases introduced vulnerabilities (shown in Table V) , while
58.3% – as measured in this study – failed to apply Rust’s
safety mechanisms. Data highlights two patterns: translations
adhering to Rust’s safeguards achieved superior outcomes
(0% VIR for safe-only code), whereas those bypassing safety
checks worsened results (16.7% VIR), proving security out-comes depend on framework adaptation rather than functional
correctness. The study disproves the assumption of automatic
security inheritance through language translation. Ultimately,
Target language’s security properties define theoretical security
boundaries, but their practical effectiveness depends on rigor-
ous adherence to safeguard mechanisms during translation.
The prevalence of input validation and security API vulner-
abilities in translated code exposes fundamental limitations in
how LLMs reconcile syntactic and functional correctness.
Input validation flaws demonstrate LLMs’ propensity for
syntactic preservation over semantic validation. While models
successfully translate explicit validation constructs with struc-
tural equivalence, most of these translated safeguards exhibit
semantic decay in boundary enforcement. This explains the
high vulnerability preservation rates (VPR=81.0%) for CWE-
20. This “validation equivalence fallacy” arises because LLMs
optimize for structural fidelity without modeling the security
implications of language-specific type systems.
Security API misuse reveals a parallel failure mode in
semantic mapping. When translating Java’s PreparedStatement
to Python DB APIs, some cases incorrectly substitute parame-
terized queries with string concatenation – a syntactically valid
but semantically dangerous pattern. The models recognize API
call structures but fail to comprehend their security purpose.
Input Validation and Security API failure patterns stem from
LLMs’ training paradigm that prioritizes syntactic congruence
over security semantics.
Real-world Risks of Vulnerable Translations.To assess
the real-world impact of vulnerable translations, we conduct
a developer study using a questionnaire based on translation
examples from our dataset. The study involve 30 participants
categorized into three groups according to their programming
and security expertise. Our survey focuses on three core as-
pects of vulnerability detection in LLM-based code translation:
•Q1: What types of issues in translated code do you find
most challenging to verify and debug?
•Q2: Vulnerability detection capability assessment through
eight translation samples.
•Q3: Which vulnerability type proved most difficult to
identify based on your evaluation experience?
Our survey results reveal critical risks posed by vulner-
able translations in real-world development scenarios. The
data demonstrates that security vulnerabilities in translated
code present significant detection challenges, with 90% of
developers identifying them as the most difficult issues to
verify – far surpassing syntactic errors (93.3% agreement
on being easiest). This perception-risk mismatch highlights a
dangerous blind spot, where the most severe vulnerabilities
are also the hardest to identify. Fig. 7 exposes concerning
accuracy limitations across all expertise levels. While senior
developers perform best (67.2% accuracy), their detection
rates remain alarmingly low given the security-critical nature.
More troubling is the observed inverse relationship between
expertise and evaluation efficiency – senior developers require
161% more time (639s vs 245s) than juniors. This suggests
that vulnerable translations force experienced developers into

defensive scrutiny patterns, while less experienced ones may
unknowingly accept flawed translations.
When asked to identify the most challenging vulnerability
types, developers equally prioritize two critical risks: security
API mismatches (43.3%) and language paradigm transitions
(36.7%). This near-even split indicates that vulnerable transla-
tions threaten systems through both localized API misuse and
systemic safety model violations. The prolonged verification
times (mean 478s) further compound these risks, as such
thorough reviews prove difficult to maintain in practice.
The complete questionnaire is available via the anonymous
link provided by our team [13].
Finding 5:Vulnerabilities in LLM-translated code are
highly severe and difficult to detect, with an average devel-
oper accuracy of only 49.6%. Senior developers, while more
accurate (67.2%), require 161% more time than juniors,
revealing an efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.
D. RQ4:Mitigation Effectiveness
To address security vulnerabilities in LLM-based code trans-
lation, we implement and evaluate two mitigation strategies:
a naive security-aware approach and a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) method [40].
Thenaive security-aware approachenhances standard
translation prompts by integrating explicit security require-
ments, instructing models to preserve functional correctness
while avoiding common vulnerability patterns. While pro-
viding a foundational layer of security guidance, its advice
remains generic and not specifically tailored to the semantic
content of the input code.
In contrast, ourRAG-based solution, as shown in Fig. 8,
employs a more sophisticated pipeline to deliver context-aware
security hardening. The system is built upon a meticulously
constructed knowledge base of vulnerability analysis reports.
This specialized dataset is curated from a corpus of code sam-
ples previously identified (via human judgment) as introducing
security vulnerabilities. To ensure comprehensive coverage,
we uniformly sampled examples across diverse CWE types.

Each selected sample was then accompanied by a manually
authored, in-depth vulnerability analysis report, detailing the
flaw’s nature, root cause, and potential ramifications. As a
result, the knowledge base for RAG retrieval contains 128
vulnerability analysis report examples.
Our RAG framework operates through a meticulously de-
signed two-phase architecture that seamlessly integrates offline
preparation with online retrieval and generation. During the
offline processing phase, we establish the foundational knowl-
edge base by employing a pre-trained sentence transformer
model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 [60]) to encode all code snippets
from our vulnerability repository into dense vector represen-
tations. This embedding process is optimized through batch
processing and L2 normalization, ensuring both computational
efficiency and optimal vector space geometry for subsequent
similarity measurements. The resulting embedding matrix is
persistently stored alongside the original vulnerability meta-
data, creating a comprehensive knowledge repository that
forms the cornerstone of our retrieval mechanism.
In the online phase, the system initializes by loading the
pre-computed embeddings and vulnerability data into memory,
ensuring rapid response capabilities. When presented with a
new code translation task, the framework first generates an
embedding vector for the input code using the same sentence
transformer model. This query embedding then undergoes a

ized prompt is presented to the backend LLM, enabling the
translation process to be informed by precise vulnerability
patterns associated with semantically similar code structures.
The prompt template employed for the RAG task in our
experiments is provided in Appendix Listing 3.
Our evaluation on 67 security-centric code samples demon-
strates progressive improvement across mitigation strategies,
with VIR consistently declining from baseline to RAG ap-
proaches (Table VII). The naive prompt reduces VIR by 25.4%
for GPT4omini and 11.2% for Deepseek compared to baseline,
confirming that explicit security constraints in prompts provide
moderate protection. However, the RAG strategy delivers sig-
nificantly better outcomes, achieving an additional 7.4% VIR
reduction over naive prompts for GPT4omini and 22.1% for
Deepseek. Notably, both models exhibit comparable sensitivity
to RAG-based mitigation, with GPT4omini showing a 32.8%
improvement and Deepseek a 33.3% improvement, suggesting
that external contextual guidance can effectively compensate
for varying model capabilities. This performance convergence
implies that well-designed mitigation strategies can bridge
inherent security awareness gaps across different LLMs.
Finding 6:Mitigation strategies demonstrate hierarchical
effectiveness, with RAG prompts achieving substantial im-
provements (32.8%–33.3%) over naive security prompts
(11.2%–25.4%). This highlights the critical role of contex-
tualized security knowledge integration in enhancing secure
code translation.
VI. DISCUSSION
A. Threats to Validity
Threats to internal validitymainly arise from potential
data leakage and the use of manual processes in dataset
construction and evaluation [70]. Although some LLMs may
have been trained on source code from STED , they lack
access to the corresponding correct translations, ruling out
task-specific fine-tuning or reinforcement. Our results show
that even when exposed to security-aware functions, LLMs
still make frequent errors in translating security APIs, suggest-
ing minimal impact from data leakage. To ensure reliability
in manual procedures, we follow standardized guidelines and
involve multiple annotators during both dataset creation and
evaluation to reduce bias and human error. For RQ2, we
employ multiple experienced researchers under a double-blind
review process, enhancing the robustness of our results.Threats to external validityrelate to the generalizability of
our findings across programming languages and security con-
texts [44], [69]. Our study focuses on five languages and nine
CWE categories, which naturally limits its scope compared to
the wide variety of domain-specific languages and vulnerabil-
ities. However, the selected languages are among the most
popular in industry [9] and represent diverse programming
paradigms relevant to secure coding [4]. The chosen CWEs
are drawn from the MITRE Top 25 [12], covering common
security scenarios. Furthermore, we conducted a thorough
analysis of all security-related translation errors using thematic
analysis to enhance the robustness and applicability of our
results. Thus, we believe the threats to external validity are
minimal within the scope of this work.
B. Pratical Value
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of
security issues in LLM-based code translation, uncovering
security risks introduced during file-level translation. Based
on our findings, our work offers the following practical value.
Value for Researchers.We provide a high-quality, security-
centric dataset aligned with real-world scenarios, along with
an automated evaluation framework to facilitate efficient as-
sessments. This fills a critical gap in security evaluation within
code translation research. Additionally, we introduce the first
taxonomy of security-related translation errors, offering a
foundational reference for future studies. Our vulnerability
analysis reports and the mitigation example presented in
RQ4 further provide actionable insights and data support for
addressing security challenges in LLM-based code translation.
Value for Practitioners.Our experimental results offer
practical guidance for developers using LLMs in real-world
code translation tasks. The overall performance assessment
in RQ1 informs model selection, while the patterns iden-
tified in RQ2 highlight key areas requiring manual review.
Furthermore, the developer survey in RQ3 emphasizes the
importance of being cautious about security risks in LLM-
based translation.
VII. CONCLUSION
This study presents the first security-centric evaluation of
LLMs in code translation tasks and constructs the first file-
level vulnerability dataset for code translation assessment. The
evaluation covers five programming languages, nine CWE
types, and five state-of-the-art LLMs. The results reveal
significant vulnerability introduction and preservation issues
in LLM-based code translation. We further conduct manual
analysis of translation errors and mitigation strategies, sum-
marizing key findings that provide valuable insights for future
research.
Based on our findings, future work may include: (1) In-
corporating static analysis tools and data retrieval techniques
to enhance prompts by real-time identification of security-
sensitive content, based on our analysis reports. (2) Extending
the current dataset with accurate translation annotations to
build a security-centric code translation dataset for model

fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. (3) Constructing high-
quality automated test suites to enable comprehensive evalua-
tion, combining existing metrics to better understand the rela-
tionship between translation accuracy and security integrity.

APPENDIX
ETHICALCONSIDERATIONS
This research utilizes security-sensitive code samples con-
taining real-world vulnerabilities, and we have proactively ad-
dressed the associated ethical concerns. All dataset is sourced
from public, historical records such as CVE/NVD, meaning
all vulnerabilities have been previously disclosed and patched,
and no zero-day vulnerabilities are included. The evaluation
process in this study does not involve any automatic execution
of code, eliminating the risk of accidentally triggering vulner-
able behaviors during dataset reuse. The ultimate goal of this
research is to enhance software security by identifying and
mitigating risks introduced by LLMs, thereby providing a net
positive contribution to the security community.
