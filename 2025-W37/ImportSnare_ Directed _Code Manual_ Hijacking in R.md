## Abstract
Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security

1 Introduction
As LLM capabilities continue to advance, their performance on
increasingly complex tasks demonstrates remarkable progress [ 11].
Code generation, as one of the core competencies of large lan-
guage models, assists both novice programmers and experienced
developers by providing code snippets, framework suggestions, and
dependency declaration recommendations, indicating LLMs’ grow-
ing comprehension and generation capabilities in coding tasks [ 4,
40,41,54]. However, due to the heightened demands for algorithmic
logic and data structure understanding in code generation tasks,
the produced code often contains functional flaws and security
vulnerabilities [ 47]. These outputs typically serve as initial proto-
types requiring manual debugging and iterative refinement before
achieving successful compilation and execution. The emergence of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology significantly
enhances code generation efficiency by providing LLMs with exten-
sive relevant documentation, while retrieved code manuals from
databases help ensure correctness and security [ 41]. Nevertheless,
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) introduces new
attack surfaces alongside its improvements [21].
RAG poisoning represents a prevalent attack vector against
RAG systems, where adversaries inject malicious documents into
databases (typically populated by web crawlers) to manipulate LLM
outputs into generating erroneous or harmful responses. Current
RAG poisoning research [ 45,57] primarily focuses on simple QA
tasks and lacks mechanisms to ensure poisoned documents get
reliably retrieved under unknown queries, significantly limiting
attack success rates and practical impact. Both RAG poisoning and
jailbreaking techniques [ 30,44,56] face a fundamental challenge:
overriding the model’s internal knowledge with external docu-
ment knowledge, assuming the training data remains largely un-
contaminated. Existing studies demonstrate that subverting model
knowledge becomes relatively straightforward through prompt ma-
nipulation, particularly for neutral factual queries, as LLM safety
alignment mechanisms cannot (and should not) comprehensively
address such knowledge-based responses. Moreover, current RAG
poisoning approaches often assume prior knowledge of user queries
for targeted poisoning, further reducing real-world applicability.arXiv:2509.07941v1  [cs.CR]  9 Sep 2025

This paper first exposes a novel attack surface in RACG targeting
malicious dependency recommendations. Our research is driven
by two key motivations. First, we aim to identify security align-
ment weaknesses in widely used code LLMs. Second, we aim to
investigate the tension between LLMs’ tendency to monopolise
dependencies, favoring a small set of popular packages, and the
associated security risks arising from insufficiently vetted third-
party dependencies in software supply chains. As demonstrated
in Figure 1, the attacker first selects target dependencies (common
Python/Rust packages like matplotlib andregex ), then identifies
relevant clean documents for poisoning. The attacker plants poi-
soned documentation (e.g., GitHub, StackOverflow) indexed by RAG
and uploads malicious packages to mainstream repositories (e.g.,
PyPI). When users query the target LLM about dependency-related
coding issues, the RAG system retrieves and incorporates relevant
documents (including poisoned ones) as contextual prompts. Cru-
cially, our poisoned documents achieve higher retrieval rankings
than the clean ones. Even with a limited poisoned context, they
successfully induce the LLM to recommend targeted dependen-
cies in code snippets, often without any explanatory warnings.
This attack exploits a dual trust chain: the LLM’s inherent trust in
RAG-retrieved documents, and users’ blind trust in LLM sugges-
tions. Such software supply chain vulnerabilities became practical
only with RACG’s emergence, as previous malicious packages in
third-party repositories lacked sufficient exposure, while LLMs
traditionally recommended only mainstream dependencies.
Constructing effective poisoned documents presents two under-
studied challenges: First, constructing poisoned documents that
achieve higher rankings than their counterparts and other clean
documents under unknown queries. Second, ensuring a limited poi-
soned context can effectively induce diverse LLMs (both open/closed-
source) to recommend specific dependencies. These requirements
demand poisoned documents exhibiting transferability across three
dimensions: user queries, retrieval models, and target LLMs.
To address these challenges, we proposeImportSnare, a frame-
work combining two orthogonal attack vectors: (1)Ranking Se-
quences: Position-aware beam search generates Unicode perturba-
tions that maximize semantic similarity to proxy queries, boosting
retrieval rankings while evading human inspection. (2)Inducing
Sequences: Multilingual inductive suggestions, refined through
LLM self-paraphrasing, embed subtle package recommendations
(e.g.,matplotlib_safe) as innocuous code comments.
Our evaluation across Python, Rust, and JavaScript ecosystems
demonstratesImportSnare’s alarming effectiveness against state-
of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-r1 and GPT-4o).ImportSnare
achieves success rates exceeding 50% for popular libraries such
asmatplotlib andseaborn , and can still succeed with poisoning
ratios of the whole RAG database as low as 0.01%, while preserving
code functionality and stealth. Notably, the framework adapts to
both synthetic (e.g., pandas_v2 ) and real-world malicious packages
(e.g., typosquatted requstss ), exhibiting cross-platform transfer-
ability across RAG systems (LlamaIndex, LangGraph) and LLM
architectures. To catalyze defense research, we release a multilin-
gual benchmark suite and datasets.
Our findings underscore an urgent need to rethink security pro-
tocols for LLM-RAG systems, where the consequences of compro-
mised outputs, from supply chain attacks to critical infrastructurebreaches, demand immediate attention. To summarize, this work
makes four key contributions:
•New Risk Exposure.First systematic study revealing de-
pendency hijacking risks in RACG via dual trust exploitation.
•A New Attack Framework.ImportSnareempirically demon-
strates how weak safety alignment in code generation en-
ables weaponization of retrieved content.
•Comprehensive Validation.Through large-scale exper-
iments, we validate the attack’s practicality, stealth, and
transferability, raising urgent concerns for LLM-powered
development tools.

marking and evaluating LLM/RAG safety in code generation,

2 Background and Related Works
2.1 Code Generation Safety in LLM
LLMs abilities in code generation has revolutionized software de-
velopment by automating the translation of natural language de-
scriptions into functional code. However, this capability introduces
significant security challenges [ 40,47], particularly in the context
of adversarial attacks such as RAG poisoning. This section outlines
the security risks associated with LLM-generated code.
Unsafe code generation.LLMs often generate code with secu-
rity flaws due to their reliance on training data that may include
insecure code patterns [ 15] and suboptimal prompts (e.g., lacking
explicit requirements for security checks). While LLMs struggle
to generate standalone malware, they can produce components
usable in complex attacks, such as file encryption routines for ran-
somware or typosquatted package names in supply chain attacks [ 7].
Adversarial examples can also be injected during pretraining or
fine-tuning, such as favoring vulnerable code patterns [46].
Domain-Specific Limitations.LLMs exhibit suboptimal per-
formance in domain-specific code generation (e.g., web or game
development), often misusing third-party libraries due to limited do-
main expertise [ 27]. This increases the risk of introducing domain-
specific vulnerabilities, such as insecure API calls.
Provider Bias and Supply Chain Risks.LLMs may exhibit
systematic biases toward specific biases when generating code,
potentially promoting monopolistic dependencies and obscuring
alternative secure solutions. Additionally, generated code might
inadvertently include deprecated or compromised packages, exac-
erbating supply chain risks.
The security of LLM-generated code hinges on addressing both
inherent model limitations (e.g., training data biases) and external
adversarial threats (e.g., poisoning attacks). While advancements in
multi-agent systems and instruction tuning show promise, ongoing
research is critical to mitigate emerging risks, particularly as LLMs
become integral to software supply chains.

third-party packages to streamline development. In Python, for

instance, developers routinely import libraries like matplotlib for vi-
sualization, pandas and numpy for data processing, and scikit-learn
for machine learning tasks. Similar patterns prevail in languages
such as Rust. These dependencies form interconnected chains, col-
lectively constituting the software supply chain. While leveraging
packages and APIs significantly reduces development costs and ac-
celerates productivity, critical security and ecosystem risks emerge
when LLMs automate dependency recommendations.
When requesting code generation from LLMs, developers in-
herently expect dependency suggestions alongside code snippets.
However, LLM-driven dependency generation introduces two chal-
lenges: malicious packages and dependency monopolization.
Malicious Packages in Software Supply Chains.Official
package repositories for many languages host numerous unvetted
or overtly malicious packages, a long-standing software supply
chain security concern [ 49]. Historically, such packages posed lim-
ited practical risk due to low exposure: without visibility, normal
users rarely encountered them organically. LLMs could theoreti-
cally amplify malicious package exposure by recommending them
during code generation [25].
Dependency Monopolization.Consistent with prior stud-
ies [4] and our own empirical findings, we observe that LLMs ex-
hibit strong dependency monopolization in code generation tasks
when no additional context is provided via RAG systems. Specifi-
cally, LLMs disproportionately favor a narrow set of widely adopted
third-party libraries. To quantify this phenomenon, we replicate the
test in [ 4] about completions of the prompt on two state-of-the-art
LLMs (DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o):
#import machine learning package
import
Our evaluation reveals striking uniformity: in 100 trials of code
completions, DeepSeek-v3 exclusively recommends sklearn in all
cases, while GPT-4o suggests sklearn 89 times and scikit-learn
9 times (both referring to the same package) at 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒= 0.
Experiments at higher temperatures(0.5, 0.7, 1.0) do not signifi-
cantly improve suggestion diversity. GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B
and DeepSeek-v3 still overwhelmingly suggested sklearn . Theseresults not only confirm the persistence of dependency monopoliza-
tion but suggest its intensification compared to earlier observations
in [4] (which showed diversity between TensorFlow and PyTorch).
2.3 RAG Poisoning in LLM
RAG has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in LLM-integrated
applications [ 17,19]. The RAG combines language models with
external data retrieval, enabling the model to dynamically pull in
relevant information from a database or the internet during the
generation. The workflow of RAG systems is typically divided into
two sequential phases:RetrievalandGeneration.
InRetrieval, RAG focuses on extracting data from diverse exter-
nal sources like specialized databases and broader internet searches.
This step is vital for enhancing LLMs’ response capabilities by pro-
viding specific information pertinent to the query. TheGeneration
involves integrating this externally retrieved data with the LLM’s
existing knowledge base. This synthesis allows the model to pro-
duce responses that are not only grounded in its comprehensive
training but also enriched with the latest, specific external data.
Compared to perturbing the training process [ 48], embedding ad-
versarial text into the input data more effectively disrupts inference,
particularly when such text is embedded as contextual content
within the LLM’s prompt.
Prior attacks primarily target isolated components or objectives.
For instance, [ 53] demonstrated corpus poisoning against retrievers
without affecting generators, while [ 28] introduced gradient-based
prompt injection but omitted retriever optimization, limiting con-
trol over contextual inputs. [ 57] advanced this with PoisonedRAG,
enabling targeted poisoning via multiple passages to force prede-
fined outputs for specific queries. While effective, their approach
lacks generality, requiring extensive adversarial resources per query.
Concurrent works further narrow the scope: [ 36] focuses solely on
inducing refusal-to-answer behaviors, and [ 6,45] address subsets
of adversarial goals.
No-trigger attack.While prior work focuses on trigger-based
attacks, we investigate triggerless attacks, which are a more practi-
cal scenario requiring no explicit triggers. The goal is to generate
adversarial documents that are retrieved for any query. Given the
infeasibility of a single universal adversarial document, the attacker
inserts a small set of adversarial documents 𝐴into the corpus 𝑃𝑛,

Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Kai Ye, Liangcai Su, and Chenxiong Qian
where|𝐴|≪|𝑃 𝑛|, such that:
𝐴:∀𝑞∈𝑄,∃𝑎′∈𝐴where𝑎′∈TopK(𝑞,𝑃 𝑛∪𝐴,𝑘)
This constitutes an inference-time attack: we assume the encoder
𝐸is fixed and pre-trained, with the attacker having only black-box
access during adversarial document generation.
2.4 Prompt Injection in LLM
Prompt injection attacks manipulate LLMs by misleading them
to deviate from the original input instructions and execute mali-
ciously injected instructions, because of their instruction-following
capabilities and inability to distinguish between the original input
instructions and maliciously injected instructions [13, 23].
Initially, researchers discovered that LLMs could be misled through
simple "ignoring prompt" techniques [ 31]. Subsequent work demon-
strated that "fake response" strategies were also effective [ 43]. More
recently, a variety of methods for prompt injection attacks have
been proposed [ 22]. Some researchers also consider the semantic
similarity between the original text and the text augmented with
triggers in their forgery, to maintain retrieval performance [ 29].
Technically, these attacks are often easier to succeed than jail-
breaking because almost all LLMs undergo extensive instruction-
following training. Defending against such attacks by simply filter-
ing instructions is challenging, as it would result in a significant
loss of functionality.
3 Threat Model and Assumptions
Target Model.In this study, we have two types of target models:
a retrieval model for searching relevant documents and an LLM
for code generation. The target model is securely trained with-
out poisoning or any other form of malicious tampering. For the
retrieval model, we select commonly used and popular retrieval
models employed in real-world RAG systems (such as LangGraph
and LLamaIndex) to closely mimic actual RAG scenarios. Addition-
ally, the retrieval model should have a context length of at least
1024 tokens. This is because when creating the RAG Database, we
split the documents into segments of length 1024 to ensure the
integrity of the code as much as possible. Regarding the LLM, we
require it to possess sufficient code-generation capabilities. In this
way, both novice coding enthusiasts and experienced programmers
will be inclined to use the suggestions provided by these LLMs
during programming.
Attacker Goal and Motivation.The attacker’s goal is to make
the target LLM generate custom library or package names in re-
sponse to general code-generation prompts. Refer to Figure 1 for
the specific attack chain. In one of the attack scenarios we present,
the attacker maliciously inserts a large number of strings contain-
ing malicious package names, as well as elements for retrieval and
generation attacks, into websites or databases that are likely to be
crawled by the RAG system and added to the RAG Database. These
malicious documents can be retrieved by the retrieval model in
the RAG system with a higher ranking and included in the RAG
context as part of the LLM prompt. Subsequently, the LLM will
trust the “suggestions” in these contexts and then recommend pro-
grammers to install and use the “suggested” third-party packages.
It should be noted that the attacker does not need to upload themalicious package first and then poison the RAG Database. In fact,
the attacker can even poison the database first and then upload
the corresponding malicious package to the third-party package
management repository based on the poisoning effect, as this is not
difficult to achieve. Therefore, in practice, the attacker can alternate
between poisoning documents and uploading malicious packages,
which makes it more challenging to defend against such attacks.
Assumptions.In our proposed malicious package attack sce-
nario, we make the following assumptions, which are both realistic
and reasonable, and the attack threat we describe is genuine and
highly likely to occur among the broad user base that relies on
LLM-based code generation.
For attackers:
•They do not require direct white-box access to target models
(both retrieval models and LLMs).
•They can upload packages containing hijacked code to third-
party package management platforms (e.g., PyPi) [26].
•They have no knowledge of the exact queries used by victims,
but can access large volumes of existing query distributions.
•They cannot delete or modify existing documents in the RAG
database and can only inject new poisoned documents.
For victims:
•They use LLMs for code generation and follow LLM-suggested
code recommendations, and are unfamiliar with the official
names of packages they might use. Since developers(including
junior engineers and even experienced programmers) are
increasingly seeking code suggestions from LLMs [ 16]. For
example, the number of monthly questions posted on Stack
Overflow has dropped to levels seen in 2009 [37].
•They typically do not manually inspect all retrieved docu-
ments, focusing solely on the LLM-generated output, given
that most web-based LLM chat interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT,
Claude and DeepSeek) do not display detailed document
sources by default. This greatly reduces the likelihood of
users discovering poisoned documents.
•They tend to directly copy and paste the code suggestions
provided by LLMs, attempt to run them, and debug as nec-
essary. Since many programming languages offer clear er-
ror messages for missing packages and dependencies (for
example, Python raises a ’No module named xx’ error),
developers can conveniently install the required packages
using commands like pip install xx . This allows them to
inadvertently complete the final step of the attack chain [ 20].
•After installing packages, they execute code immediately
without verifying whether the packages contain unknown
malicious code. Malicious packages can be disguised as legit-
imate dependencies, exploit vulnerabilities in the develop-
ment workflow, and conceal malicious logic, thereby causing
victims to unknowingly use them [32, 42, 52].
4 Methodology
4.1 Overview
Constructing poisoned documents constitutes the most critical yet
challenging component of ourImportSnareattack framework, as
it fundamentally determines: (1) whether the poisoned documents

added to the corpus can be consistently retrieved by RAG systems,
and (2) their ability to override the LLM’s internal knowledge (rep-
resented by model weights). We assume the model’s training data
(encoded in weights) contains only clean library and package names.
Drawing inspiration from [ 57], our approach involves inserting two
distinct adversarial sequences:Ranking SequenceandIncuding
Sequenceinto clean documents. These perturbations are designed
to specifically target contriever and LLM code generation capabil-
ities, respectively. Note that the insertion positions of these two
sequences do not need to be colocated, and maintaining positional
alignment is unnecessary for achieving adversarial objectives. The
overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2.
We subsequently detail the generation mechanisms for both
sequences. We refer to the method of constructing the Ranking
Sequence asImportSnare-R, and the method of constructing the
Inducing Sequence asImportSnare-G. As the names imply, the goals
of these two sequences are to influence ranking and generation,
respectively. Note that unlike conventional inducing methods that
manipulate prompts, our sequences require neither semantic co-
herence nor low perplexity. Counterintuitively, increased sequence
nonsensicality enhances stealth. Even when users manually inspect
retrieved documents, the meaningless patterns evade suspicion.
This paradigm shift allows us to focus exclusively on optimizing
sequence injection efficiency and cross-model transferability, rather
than maintaining human-interpretable characteristics.
4.2 Retrieved Documents and Proxy Queries
As described in the threat model, one of our key assumptions is that
attackers are unaware of the real user queries when performing
poisoning attacks. Consequently, attackers can only approximate
real-world queries through a large number of proxy queries. The
closer the distribution of proxy queries is to that of real user queries,
the higher the attack efficiency.

We use proxy queries to get related documents targeting a
certain package, and poison documents by increasing the
embedding similarity of them to proxy queries.
Proxy Query Acquisition.Given a document corpus Dand
proxy query poolQ, we establish bidirectional retrieval mapping
using the embedding model from the local surrogate contriver that
retrieves relevant documents from knowledge databases:
(
R(𝑄𝑝)=Top-𝐾arg max 𝐷∈D cos(𝐸(𝑄𝑝),𝐸(𝐷))
R−1(𝐷)={𝑄 𝑝∈Q|𝐷∈R(𝑄 𝑝)}
where𝐸(·) computes the average embedding vector of all tokens
in a sequence, 𝐾defines the retrieval depth. Each document 𝐷is
associated withQ(𝐷)
𝑝=R−1(𝐷).
As shown in the Figure 3, we first obtain the documents to be
poisoned using proxy queries. Then, we trace back to find all the
corresponding proxy queries that retrieved these documents. Sub-
sequently, we insert rank sequences to enhance the embedding
similarity between the documents and proxy queries. Ultimately,

Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Kai Ye, Liangcai Su, and Chenxiong Qian
our goal is to improve the embedding similarity between the poi-
soned documents and the real user queries.
4.3ImportSnare-R: Retrieval-Oriented
Document Poisoning
Objective.The gold ofImportSnare-R is to maximize the embedding
similarity of poisoned document 𝐷′with the proxy queries Q𝑝while
maintaining stealthiness.
Gradient-Guided Position-Token Optimization.For each
document𝐷, we solve the constrained optimization to get the rank
sequence, which is the best perturbation to the document that
maximizes the embedding similarity:
Δ∗=arg max
Δ1
|Q(𝐷)
𝑝|∑︁

𝑝cos(𝐸(𝐷⊕Δ),𝐸(𝑄 𝑝))
subject to:
•Position Constraint: Δshould be inserted at line-end posi-
tionsP end={𝑝 1,...,𝑝𝑁}
•Length Constraint:|Δ|≤𝐿 max
To efficiently generate high-quality Ranking Sequences, we em-
ploy a position-aware beam search strategy that balances explo-
ration of potential outputs with optimization of sequence likelihood.
Unlike original beam search, our approach makes full use of code
snippets in which sequences can be inserted at arbitrary positions
without being noticed.
We adapt an algorithm inspired by HotFlip [ 9] as shown in
Algorithm 1. At first, the initial candidate beams (i.e., candidate
sequences) are inserted at the end of each line in 𝐷, with the num-
ber of beams corresponding to the total number of lines. During
𝑁iterative rounds, we employ sequence embedding similarity as
both the objective function and scoring metric, utilizing gradient
information through an algorithm analogous to HotFlip to identify
the optimal sequence and its insertion position. While all candidate
positions are initially included in the beam, suboptimal positions
may be progressively discarded during iterations. This substantially
mitigates the additional computational overhead that would other-
wise arise from introducing an extra traversal loop to determine
the optimal insertion position. Note that after constructing the In-
ducing Sequence inImportSnare-G, we conduct another round of
reSearchon the previous Ranking Sequence with a shorter itera-
tion. Because we find that after inserting the Inducing Sequence,
the score of the original optimal Ranking Sequence is likely to be
affected, and may even drop below the initial one. Therefore, we
use the original Ranking Sequence as the initial sequence for the
reSearchand set the number of iterations 𝑁′to be smaller, as the
convergence in the second round is much faster.

4.4 ImportSnare-G: Adversarial Code Suggestion
Injection
Objective.Maximize generation probability 𝑃(𝑙∗|𝑥,𝐷′)for target
package𝑙∗through multilingual suggestions.
Generation of Inductive Suggestions.In this part, we use a
very simple but effective way to generate the inducing sequence.
First, we opt for a local proxy open-source LLM, such as Llama-3.2,
to generate text sequences. The goal is to make LLM generate the
target package names. These inducing sequence is then inserted
as code comment right after the declaration lines of packages or
libraries in the document code. We leverage several of the most
popular and outstanding LLMs to generate a set of suggestions.
Then we select eight SOTA LLMs that support multiple languages
to generate “suggestions”. These suggestions cover multiple aspects,
including security, reliability, functionality, stability, and usability.
This is because we believe that LLMs have a better understanding
of themselves and can generate “suggestions” that they are more
likely to trust and accept.

For better transferability, as well as enhancing the concealment
of the inducing sequences, we translate these suggestions into eight
common languages (including English, Chinese, and French) and
select the version with maximum probability.

Teacher-Forcing Probability Optimization.We employ teacher
forcing to compute the generation probability of target package
names in LLMs. Specifically, we first establish baseline token posi-
tions for both original and target package names using English pro-
totype suggestions. By freezing the prefix sequence preceding the
target name’s expected position, we calculate the subsequent gen-
eration probability through multiplicative accumulation of token-
level probabilities. For each suggestion 𝑠∈S all, we compute the
probabilities of generating the target package using teacher forcing,
which means that the probabilities are computed by conditioning
on the LLM output q.:
𝑃target(𝑠)=|𝑙∗|Ö
𝑡=1𝑃(𝑦𝑡=𝑙∗
𝑡|𝑥=[CodeContext;𝑠],𝜃)
where𝜃represents the victim LLM’s parameters.
The optimal suggestion𝑠∗is selected via:
𝑠∗=arg max

Our objective is to determine which suggestion patterns most
effectively induce the proxy LLM to recommend the target package
over the original implementation. While the actual insertion posi-
tions may vary across different suggestions and the computed prob-
abilities might deviate from real-world distributions, this position-
aware probability estimation provides sufficient discriminative
power for top-1 candidate selection through comparative analysis.
To some extent,ImportSnare-G is more akin to an indirect prompt
injection. By leveraging the instruction-following capabilities of
current LLMs, as well as their lack of relevant security alignment,
we are able to induce the LLMs to generate code suggestions that
deliberately include our target package names.
5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Target Package
In our evaluation, the names of the target packages are both manu-
ally created and existing.
In our experiments, we constructed malicious package names
based on real-world malicious packages and insights from recent
research [ 32,42,52]. Existing malicious package naming strate-
gies [ 26] include typosquatting (e.g., requests vs.requesqs ), de-
pendency confusion (e.g., uploading a package named “ lodash ”with a higher version number to mimic a JavaScript library), im-
personating security updates or patches (using keywords such as
“security, ” “update, ” or “patch”), and mimicking submodules or func-
tionalities of legitimate libraries (e.g., numpy vs.numpy-core ). Fol-
lowing these patterns, we designed a series of custom ’potential’
malicious package names to test whether LLMs could be deceived.
It is important to note that we did not use the same type of
malicious name extension for all target packages, such as uniformly
appending the suffix “ _safe ” or adding the prefix “ robust_ ”. As
previously mentioned, we considered a variety of malicious name
extensions based on real-world cases, including different types of
prefixes, suffixes, and common misspellings. Conducting identical
experiments for every target package by exhaustively combining
all possible malicious name extensions would not only be of limited
value but would also unnecessarily bloat our experimental results.
In fact, the attack success rate depends both on the specific
target package (for example, highly popular packages like numpy
that frequently appear in LLM training data may be harder to attack
successfully) and on the type of malicious name extension used
(for instance, misspelling-based attacks may become more effective
as LLMs’ typo-correction abilities improve). Our main objective is
to demonstrate that our approach can successfully attack a wide
range of popular packages using both real-world (for the actually
existing malicious library names, we mark them with "*" in the
table. These names are collected from [ 26]) and custom malicious
package names.
Nevertheless, we conducted an ablation study using the target
package seaborn to investigate the impact of different malicious
name extensions on the attack success rate.
5.2 Datasets
To validate the effectiveness of our novelImportSnareattack frame-
work, we construct new benchmarks and datasets by systematically
categorizing and aggregating common code-related datasets ac-
cording to programming languages. We selectPython,Rust, and
JavaScript—three widely adopted languages with frequent third-
party library dependencies. For language selection rationale, refer
to Table 9 in Appendix § A.5, which lists the related information
about the six most commonly used programming languages, and
details the exclusion of other popular languages due to significant
discrepancies between their third-party library usage and instal-
lation workflows and our attack chain architecture. While these
discrepancies pose challenges for attacking languages like C/C++
under our current framework, we emphasize that this does not
imply immunity for other languages, as discussed in Section § 7.3.
For each selected language, we partition datasets into RAG Data-
base and Query Dataset components.RAG Database: Comprises
code-related datasets from Huggingface containing complete code
snippets with explicit third-party package/library declarations. We
prioritize dataset diversity and size to approximate real-world RAG
retrieval scenarios, though true simulation remains infeasible due
to the dynamic nature of production RAG systems. Notably, these
datasets closely align with those used in LLM training, explaining
current models’ proficiency in generating complete code snippets.
Query Dataset.Consists of real-world programming queries
matching typical user distributions. This dataset was split 8:2 into

Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Kai Ye, Liangcai Su, and Chenxiong Qian
proxy and test subsets. The 80% proxy queries were used to poison
relevant database entries, while the 20% test queries were strictly
held out for evaluation. Crucially, no overlap exists between proxy
and test queries to maintain validity under our threat model. Dataset
sources details are shown in Table 10 in the Appendix.
Poisoning Ratio.Unless otherwise specified, in our experi-
ments, we poison all documents related to the target package that
are identified through proxy queries as described in § 4.2. It should
be noted that the actual poisoning ratio is calculated as the pro-
portion of poisoned documents among all documents in the whole
database. Consequently, in all experiments, the poisoning ratio is
far less than 100%, depending on the number and diversity of proxy
queries used. Table 1 shows the default poisoning ratios for all
target databases.
5.3 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate our framework using the following metrics.
•Attack Success Rate (ASR).ASR measures the propor-
tion of test queries for each target library where the LLM’s
response contains the target library name. Notably, LLMs
typically include library names in import statements dur-
ing code generation (though they may also appear in ex-
planations, comments, or post-code descriptions). We only
consider cases where the target library appears in import
statements; other occurrences, such as those in comments,
are ignored.
•Precision@k.Following prior work [ 57], Precision@k quan-
tifies the fraction of poisoned documents containing the
target library name within the top-k results retrieved by
Contriever. We exclude recall and F1-score because preci-
sion alone suffices to evaluate ranking attack efficiency in
RAG systems. Unless otherwise specified, we set 𝑘=10by
default (which is a common setting in RAG systems).
•#Queries.This metric represents the average number of
proxy queries per poisoned document. As attackers do not
know real user queries, a lower #Queries (at fixed ASR) indi-
cates easier attacks, requiring fewer proxies to approximate
user query distributions.
•Average Processing Time (APT).APT measures the mean
time per document required to execute poisoning. Lower
APT values enable attackers to rapidly inject large volumes
of poisoned documents into RAG databases.
5.4 Models
A RAG system contains two models: the contriever for retrieving
related documents with the input query given by the user, and an
LLM to generate the code snippet with the user query and top-k
documents as the context, combining the whole prompt.
Contriever.We consider three retrievers: mGTE [ 50], and bge-
base-en-v1.5 [ 3], all-mpnet-base-v2 [ 33] and e5-base-v2 [ 39]. By
default, we use the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors
of a question and a text in the knowledge database of the local proxy
retriever to calculate their similarity score.
LLM.We evaluate ourImportSnareon many SOTA LLMs that
have powerful code generation abilities. For the surrogate mod-
els, we use LLama3.2-3B [ 10], Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct [ 14]and CodeLlama-7b-Python-hf [ 34]. For target LLMs, we choose
both open-source and closed-source LLMs, including DeepSeek
series [ 11] (DeepSeek V3, R1), GPT series (GPT4-Turbo, GPT4o,
GPT4o-mioi), and Claude (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). To ensure repro-
ducibility, we set 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒= 0and𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑= 100. The prompt we
use in our evaluation is shown in the Appendix § A.4.
5.5 Attack Parameters
In ourImportSnare-R method, unless otherwise specified, we set
maximum sequence length 𝐿=20, beam width 𝐵= 10, top can-
didates per position 𝑘𝑏=15, number of iterations of first search
𝑁= 50and number of iterations of research 𝑁′=25by default.
The number of initial insertion positions num_pos is determined by
the number of lines in the document, and we default to inserting
the Ranking Sequence at the end of each line of the document. For
the local proxy LLM, we use LLama3.2-3B by default. For the local
proxy LLM, we use GPT4o-mini by default. For the local proxy
contriever, we use gte-base-en-v1.5 by default.
5.6 Baselines
We choose ReMiss [ 44], a SOTA jailbreaking method, as baselines
for our generation attack against our proposedImportSnare-G. We
also choose HotFlip [ 9] as baselines for our retrieval attack part
against our proposedImportSnare-R.
6 Results
We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effective-
ness, transferability, and practicality of our proposed method.
6.1 Effectiveness ofImportSnare
For performance benchmarking, we select state-of-the-art LLMs
(both open/closed-source) renowned for code generation capa-
bilities. Our evaluation covers Python, Rust and JavaScript-three
languages with heavy third-party dependency usage patterns. As
shown in Table 1, our findings are summarized as follows.
Query Efficiency.Across all the target package names, poison-
ing required only about 3 surrogate queries on average to establish
attack relevance.
Precision@k.Achieve values exceeding 5 for Python/Rust tar-
gets, indicating over 50% of poisoned documents ranked in the
Top-10 retrievals per test query.
Attack Success Rate (ASR).Our method demonstrates remark-
able efficacy against closed-source SOTA LLMs (e.g., 67% ASR on
GPT-4o and 51% on DeepSeek-r1), successfully overriding internal
model knowledge and safety alignment to induce targeted depen-
dency recommendations. Notably, even explicitly suspicious names
likemalware_seaborn achieved high ASR (over 30%), revealing crit-
ical trust vulnerabilities. Although ASR is lower on some black-box
LLMs, these results are achieved via transfer attacks, highlighting
strong transferability; meanwhile, the Precision@k remains high,
indicating poisoned documents often appear in model contexts.
Package Naming Dynamics.Packages with names like safe,
robust, or v2 achieved high ASR (mostly over 20%), exploiting LLMs’
preference for “trustworthy” naming conventions. Misspelled names
(e.g., requstss ,cumpy ) showed lower ASR due to LLMs’ strong

ImportSnare: Directed "Code Manual" Hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY
typo-correction capabilities, a sharp contrast to traditional soft-
ware supply chain risks where typosquatting dominates. Known
malicious packages (e.g., tn-moment ) achieved poor ASR, aligning
with typosquatting observations and suggesting LLMs inherit some
malware awareness from training data.
Notice that Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibits unusually high ASR (all
over 50%) against Rust-related poisoning despite its superior gen-
eral code generation performance, suggesting insufficient safety
alignment for Rust-specific dependencies. JavaScript shows sig-
nificantly lower ASR compared to Python/Rust, likely due to its
flexible dependency import patterns (e.g., HTTP-based imports)
versus strict import/use declarations.
It is important to note that our primary goal in designing these
package names was to demonstrate that our approach is effective
not only against existing malicious package names, but also pro-
vides attackers with the flexibility to control and customize package
names, thus amplifying the security risk. For example, an attacker
could preemptively poison a set of customized package names be-
fore uploading the actual malicious packages. Our experimental
results confirm that current LLMs lack defences against these types
of malicious package names.
6.2 Performance compared to other baselines
Our experimental comparison in Table 2 evaluates four baselines
with ourImportSnare. The Naive means Basic implementation with-
out ranking sequences, containing only a single unoptimized ’secu-
rity’ suggestion in package comments. For HotFlip [ 9], we use it to
generate the ranking sequence; for the jailbreaking sequence, we
use the naive suggestion. For ReMiss [ 44], we test both with and
without our ranking sequence integration.
The table shows that ourImportSnareachieves substantially
higher ASR across all target packages compared to baselines.Im-
portSnareoutperforms HotFlip in search rankings, demonstrating
our ranking sequence’s superiority in elevating poisoned documen-
tation visibility. While ReMiss with our ranking sequence achieves
comparable Precision@k to our method, its ASR remains signifi-
cantly lower. The gibberish-like jailbreaking sequences generated
by ReMiss exhibit low transferability. This aligns with our attack
insight, i.e., successful poisoning primarily relies on convincing the
model to adopt our crafted ’usage recommendations’.
6.3 Ratio of Poisoned Documents
We select matplotlib (matplotlib_safe ) as target package and
inject poisoned documentation into the database following the pro-
portion ratios illustrated in Figure 4. The total document count is
calculated based on all matplotlib-related entries (i.e., documents
containing “ matplotlib ”). ASR improvement emerges when poi-
soning proportion of relevant documents exceeds 3% of relevant
documents (0.01% of total documents), demonstrating that suc-
cessful attacks require minimal poisoned documentation, which
validates the practical viability of our method, since making bulk
poisoning practically impossible, particularly given that real-world
RAG databases are orders of magnitude larger than experimen-
tal setups. Note that divergent growth patterns between ASR and
Precision@K metrics reveal that at low poisoning ratios, docu-
ment ranking improvements yield disproportionate benefits to ASR,

which provides empirical evidence for both the effectiveness and
operational practicality of our approach in real-world deployment
scenarios.
In the Appendix § A.3, we provide a real-world example demon-
strating how Copilot in VSCode could be misled into suggesting
malicious packages through manipulated reference documentation.
6.4 Ablation Study
Module ablation.The experimental results in Figure 5 demon-
strate that component R significantly enhances the retrieval ranking
of poisoned documents, while component G effectively improves
the target LLM’s success rate in generating desired package imports.
However, introducing new sequences through G may inadvertently
degrade R’s effectiveness by altering the embedding similarity be-
tween documents and queries. Therefore, our additional round
of R compensates for this ranking degradation caused by G’s in-
terference. The R(N+N’) experiments further validate that simply
increasing first-round iteration counts cannot substitute for this
dedicated compensation mechanism. Notably, while the R+G order-
ing shows marginally better performance than G+R, the difference
remains subtle, which stems from their asymmetric mutual influ-
ence patterns, where G’s impact on R outweighs R’s effect on G,
despite both being relatively limited in magnitude.
Hyperparameter tuning.We select Maximum sequence length
(𝐿), Beam width ( 𝐵) and Top candidates per position ( 𝑘𝑏), three
hyperparameters that have the greatest impact on performance.
The results are shown in Figure 6.
Due to the inherent characteristics of the beam search algorithm,
in essence, when computational resources are sufficient, larger
values for these three hyperparameters generally lead to better per-
formance. However, the marginal gains in performance diminish
as the values increase, while the time overhead for constructing
a poisoned document rises significantly. Therefore, our default

hyperparameter selection balances the largest feasible combina-
tion supported by the experimental equipment with acceptable
efficiency, avoiding excessive slowdown.
Local proxy LLM selection.We investigate the impact of local
surrogate model selection on ASR, as shown in Table 3. Since our
method strategically generates inductive suggestions optimized to
maximize the probability of inducing target package names in local
models, the transferability of these suggestions between surrogate
and target LLMs becomes crucial. Experimental results demon-
strate enhanced transferability when employing larger models (e.g.,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct and CodeLlama-7b-Python-HF), which
exhibit superior generalization capabilities compared to smaller
variants. This observation clarifies that while our default choice
of Llama3.2-3B (due to computational constraints in other exper-
iments) achieves competent performance, it does not inherently
represent the optimal proxy model. The performance gap primarilystems from larger models’ improved capacity to capture transfer-
able semantic patterns between suggestion crafting and target LLM
execution.
Precision@k.Since RAG-LLMs can flexibly select how many
retrieved documents to use, as we use k=10 in most experiments
(which is a common setting in RAG systems). We also conduct an
ablation study on the number of documents selected by the LLM
from those retrieved via RAG, i.e., the value of k in Precision@k, as
shown in the Table 4. Our results indicate that increasing k leads to
more poisoned documents being retrieved by RAG; however, this
does not necessarily correspond to a higher proportion of poisoned
documents, nor does it guarantee a higher ASR. Nonetheless, what
is truly important is that we demonstrate our method can effectively
compromise several of the most popular Python packages across
different values of k.

6.5 Influences on Code Generation Quality
We evaluate the effects of poisoned RAG databases by comparing
code outputs generated using both poisoned and clean documenta-
tion sources in Table 5. Code quality assessment employed Bandit
(security analysis), Pylint (code quality scoring), and Flake8 (syn-
tactic verification), with metrics including (1)#Security Issues
from security vulnerabilities detected by Bandit. (2)#High Sever-
ityfrom critical-risk vulnerabilities from Bandit. (3)Pylint Score
from comprehensive code quality rating by Pylint, 0-10 scale. (4)
#Flake8 Errorsfrom code syntax/style violations from Flake8.
Statistical significance across all four metrics was rigorously
verified through Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, with Bonferroni cor-
rection applied to address multiple comparison effects. This analysis
quantifies how documentation poisoning influences not just ASR
but also fundamental code integrity characteristics.Table 3: Comparison of different local LLMs on GPT4o-mini

The analysis reveals that while code generated using poisoned
documentation contains measurable quantities of potential bugs,
these differences show no statistically significant deviation from
the clean documentation group ( 𝑝𝑊𝑖𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑥𝑜𝑛 <𝛼= 0.05), which is re-
inforced by the adjusted 𝛼′=𝛼/𝑚 from Bonferroni correction. This
is because of the inherent nature of current LLM-generated code,
where initial outputs frequently contain errors and vulnerabilities
regardless of documentation quality. The observed parity in code
quality metrics between poisoned and clean conditions suggests
our attack method preserves the LLM’s baseline code generation
characteristics while achieving its security objectives.
6.6 Transferability
Transferability serves as a critical metric for evaluating the perfor-
mance of RAG poisoning attacks. In our transferability experiments,
we systematically examine three dimensions: 1) cross-retrieval
model transferability (testing with different retrieval models be-
tween real user query processing and poisoned document con-
struction), 2) cross-target model transferability (as demonstrated
in § 6.1), and 3) cross-linguistic query transferability (considering
users’ potential multilingual interactions when seeking LLM-based
code generation suggestions).
Contriever.The cross-retrieval model experimental results
in Table 6 reveal that while attack effectiveness diminishes when
switching retrieval models, successful compromises remain achiev-
able. This performance degradation primarily stems from distinct

6.7 Mitigation
Since we are the first work to comprehensively propose this attack,
no validated defense method currently exists against it. Therefore,
we propose a detection approach as a mitigation strategy in this
part. We leverage LLM to detect malicious and harmful components
throughout the attack process. Specifically, we submit three criti-
cal elements: the RAG-retrieved documents, the complete prompt
submitted to the target LLM, and the LLM’s output, to a powerful
LLM for judgment and detection. Our primary approach involves
querying the LLM to determine whether the provided materials
(documents, prompts, and outputs) contain harmful code or suspi-
cious dependency libraries.
This interim mitigation comes with consideration of alternative
mitigation measures and their potential consequences.Allowlist.Although potentially effective, enforcing strict al-
lowlist filtering in dependency recommendations for RACG may
further exacerbate dependency monopolization.
Rule-based detection of suggestions.Our recommendations
focus on functionality, security, and integrity, making them inap-
propriate for prohibition, especially in code comments.
Detection of nonsensical strings in documents.We can-
not reasonably prohibit random gibberish in RAG-provided code
manuals where such patterns commonly occur.

Figure 7: Mitigation results. Documents, Prompt and Re-
sponse above denote three possible stages to detect the poten-
tially harmful or unsafe content. The y-axis is the cumulative
detection success rate. We use DeepSeek-v3 as the detector.
As shown in Figure 7, DeepSeek-v3 demonstrates partial effec-
tiveness in detecting our poisoning attacks. For RAG documents,
the detection success rate is low because not all the documents are
poisoned, plus computational costs when applied to all retrieved
documents. Full-prompt detection shows effectiveness with simi-
lar scalability challenges. Output-based detection achieves lower
accuracy despite its cost efficiency.
Our findings reveal that while LLM-based detection can identify
potential malicious content in documents, prompts, and outputs,
this approach faces significant limitations, including high opera-
tional costs and low success rates, even when disregarding recall
rate considerations.

7 Discussion
7.1 Threats in RAG-LLM
Through empirical demonstration of poisoning attacks in RACG,
we systematically reveal their risks and security implications in
LLM-based code generation and software supply chain ecosystems.
However, we contend that the attack surface extends far beyond
these initial findings. LLM sub-tasks that rely on contextual knowl-
edge provided by RAG systems can be vulnerable to such attacks.
To a large extent, the effectiveness of such attacks depends on how
much the LLM trusts the additional RAG-provided documents, as
well as the choices it makes when there is a conflict between this
external knowledge and its internal knowledge [ 38]. LLMs exhibit
notable susceptibility to manipulative contextual cues when resolv-
ing conflicts between their internal knowledge and document-level
misinformation [ 1]. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by lim-
itations in existing safety alignment techniques, which frequently
fall short in code generation scenarios where malicious patterns can
be obfuscated more effectively than in natural language contexts.
7.2 Real-world Implications and Practicality
Here we consider the real-world implications.
Poisoning Ratio.Although our evaluation includes as many
datasets to form the RAG database, it remains far from real-world
RAG systems, and approximating their scale is impractical. Even
if we poison 100% of relevant documents, their proportion in the
real RAG database would still be negligible. However, this does
not mean that the attack effectiveness scales proportionally with
database size. Previous works do not discuss the practicality related
to poisoning rates. The lowest poisoning rate mentioned in [ 57] is
10% (with a default of 50% in most of their experiments) in order
to manipulate the LLM outputs. In contrast, ourImportSnarecan
successfully conduct attacks under more challenging generation
control requirements and at much lower poisoning rates. We argue
that, rather than the poisoning rate itself, a more important factor is
improving Precision@k under the realistic scenario where queries
are unknown, thereby enabling more poisoned documents to be
retrieved by the RAG system. This aspect has not been considered
in prior research and is a key focus of our experimental evaluation.
Reranking Mechanisms.Real RAG systems incorporate com-
plex retrieval enhancements like reranking, complicating efforts
to simulate real-world scenarios using local proxy models. These
sophisticated mechanisms may degrade the transferability of ad-
versarial perturbations optimized on simplified proxies.
Code Comments.We observe that some LLM-generated code
containing malicious libraries includes comments such as “Accord-
ing to suggestions, we use xx library” or “Using xx library is safer”.
While these annotations could alert users to attack intent or further
deceive them, controlling their presence in code outputs remains
challenging. Importantly, this does not undermine the attack effi-
ciency of our framework. As LLMs improve their code and annota-
tion generation capabilities, high-quality annotations may become
both beneficial and vulnerable to poisoning. This intriguing duality
warrants future exploration.
Real-world Coding Agents.Our method successfully attacks
real-world coding agents (e.g., Cursor, Copilot), as shown in the
Appendix § A.3. However, large-scale testing on such agents ischallenging, so we do not report quantitative metrics. Most coding
agents generate code suggestions by incorporating code files from
local repositories (often allowing users to specify particular files
as code manuals). When some of these local files contain poisoned
code, such attacks become feasible, as developers rarely check every
file after cloning a repository. Furthermore, the latest coding agents
leverage real-time internet search to retrieve relevant documents
for code generation and repair suggestions. This further increases
the risk of attack, since our code poisoning can more easily occur in
popular, open code sources like GitHub and Stack Overflow, where
anyone can upload or edit content.
Internal RAG Databases and LLMs within Companies.Re-
garding the practicality of our method against internal RAG databases
and proprietary LLMs within companies, we believe that while the
risk may be somewhat reduced, it still remains widespread. First,
most companies (capable of building their own RAG databases
and training internal LLMs) typically source their databases from
web-crawled data and online documents. Although internal review
mechanisms may filter out some poisoned documents, the stealth-
iness of our poisoning techniques means that both manual and
LLM-assisted screening are likely to allow some poisoned docu-
ments to enter the internal database. Second, SOTA RAG-LLMs
proactively search for documents from the Internet rather than
relying solely on internal databases. This shifts the attacker’s fo-
cus from compromising isolated databases to enhancing document
retrieval poisoning strategies.
Potential Poisoning Corpora.Our observations show that
code-generation queries often semantically align with developer
forums like StackOverflow, Github and CSDN, making poisoned
content on such platforms more likely to be retrieved by RAG
systems. As LLMs’ search capabilities continue to improve, the
search space expands accordingly, meaning that any content on the
internet could potentially be crawled by LLMs as a "Code Manual"
to guide code generation.
7.3 Programming Languages of Supply Chain
Notwithstanding, we choose three kinds of programming languages
for evaluation, but there are still other programming languages at
risk. The attack success rate and ease of attack depend on both the
related materials in the training dataset and the size of documents
from RAG systems. Typically, a smaller training dataset and more
related RAG documents mean that LLM would prefer to trust the
documents more than the internal knowledge inside the model
weights, resulting in a better attack success rate.
7.4 Ethics
First we emphasize that our research and the development ofIm-
portSnarehave not been leveraged for any unethical activities or
financial gain. We are acutely aware of the ethical implications of
our work. We then discuss potential ethical issues raised in the
study, specifically, the disclosure of the proposed attack. Although
we demonstrate the potential for such attacks in SOTA LLM tools,
including web-based chat interfaces, API calls, and coding assis-
tants,we have not yet observed any real-world (in-the-wild)
attack cases in RACG to the best of our knowledge. However,
this does not mean that such threats can be ignored. Since many

Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Kai Ye, Liangcai Su, and Chenxiong Qian
LLM vendors are not yet aware of this type of attack, it still poses
a significant risk of exploitation. We have responsibly notified all
relevant companies via email about the potential attacks and threats
we have disclosed.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we identify a critical attack surface in RACG, directed
malicious dependency hijacking, exposing dual trust chain risks
from LLM reliance on RAG and developer overtrust in LLM sugges-
tions. We proposeImportSnare, a novel attack framework that crafts
poisoned documentation via two synergistic strategies: position-
aware beam search to optimize retrieval rankings and multilingual
inductive suggestions to jailbreak LLM dependency recommenda-
tions. Our experiments across Python, Rust, JavaScript, and SOTA
LLMs demonstrateImportSnare’s alarming efficacy, achieving 50%+
success rates against popular dependencies like matplotlib with
low poisoning ratios, even for real-world malicious packages. We
release a multilingual benchmark to spur defense research. This
study highlights urgent supply chain risks in LLM-driven devel-
opment, necessitating proactive hardening of RAG systems before
broader deployment.

A Research Methods
A.1GetTopKCandidates
The token replacement strategyGetTopKCandidatesin the Al-
gorithm 1 in § 4.3 leverages gradient directions to approximateoptimal substitutions. Given a token sequence 𝑠with length 𝐿, let
𝑤𝑗denote the token at position 𝑗, and𝑒𝑤𝑗∈R𝑑its corresponding
embedding vector. For similarity score function 𝐸(𝑠), the selection
process of top𝑘 𝑏candidate tokens𝑇 𝑗is formalized as follows:
Gradient computing:
∇𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)=𝜕𝐸(𝑠)
𝜕𝑒𝑤𝑗∈R𝑑(4)
where∇𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠) represents the gradient of the similarity score with
respect to the 𝑗-th token’s embedding. This gradient vector indicates
the direction in embedding space that would maximally increase
𝐸(𝑠).
Projection Criterion: For each candidate token 𝑡∈𝑉 (vocab-
ulary), compute the directional derivative along the replacement
vector(𝑒𝑡−𝑒𝑤𝑗):
𝜙(𝑡|𝑗)=∇ 𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)⊤(𝑒𝑡−𝑒𝑤𝑗)(5)
Simplified Scoring: Since 𝑒𝑤𝑗is constant for position 𝑗, we
reduce the computation to:
𝜙(𝑡|𝑗)=∇ 𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)⊤𝑒𝑡
|         {z         }
target term−∇𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)⊤𝑒𝑤𝑗
|           {z           }
constant offset(6)
The top-𝑘 𝑏candidates at position𝑗are selected by:
𝑇𝑗=top-𝑘𝑏
𝑡∈𝑉\{𝑤𝑗}𝜙(𝑡|𝑗)(7)
Theoretical Justification: This approximation derives from
the first-order Taylor expansion of the score function around𝑒 𝑤𝑗:
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑠′)≈𝐸(𝑠)+∇ 𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)⊤(𝑒𝑡−𝑒𝑤𝑗)(8)
where𝑠′denotes the modified sequence after replacing 𝑤𝑗with
𝑡. Maximizing this approximation directly corresponds to our pro-
jection criterion.
In practice, the scores of candidate tokens can be computed
efficiently via matrix multiplication:
Φ𝑗=∇𝑒𝑤𝑗𝐸(𝑠)·𝐸⊤∈R|𝑉|(9)
where𝐸∈R|𝑉|×𝑑is the embedding matrix. The top- 𝑘𝑏indices
fromΦ𝑗(excluding the original token index) yield the candidate
set𝑇𝑗.
A.2 Multilingual Inductive Suggestions
In Table 8 we show all the English candidate inductive suggestions
we use in the evaluation, as suggestions in other languages are the
same.
A.3 Real-world Demo
Here we present a concrete example demonstrating how Copilot
in VSCode could be misled into suggesting malicious packages
through manipulated reference documentation, as shown in Fig-
ure 8. In our experiment, we queried the model regarding a data pro-
cessing task potentially related tonumpylibrary functionality. By
intentionally manipulating the reference code documentation, we
successfully induced Copilot to recommend a solution containing
a malicious dependency. This vulnerability poses significant risks

ImportSnare: Directed "Code Manual" Hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation Conference ’25, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY
as inexperienced developers might directly implement these AI-
suggested code snippets and subsequently install the compromised
package through pip install commands without proper validation.

tions, with the[context]and[question]from the specific query.
