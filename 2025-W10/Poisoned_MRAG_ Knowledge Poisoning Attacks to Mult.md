1 Introduction
To address the limitations of parameter-only knowledge storage [ 47;24;6] in state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) like GPT-4o [ 17] and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [ 1], which struggle to adapt to rapidly changing information,
researchers have integrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [ 23] into multimodal frameworks [ 46;14;32;56;5].
A typical multimodal RAG framework consists of three key components (illustrated on the right side of Figure 1): a
multimodal knowledge database containing diverse documents, a retriever based on a multimodal embedding model
for cross-modal retrieval, and a VLM that generates responses based on the retrieved data. By leveraging multimodal
RAG, VLMs can dynamically access relevant information from external knowledge sources, enhancing adaptability
and performance. This makes multimodal RAG models particularly promising for high-stakes fields like medical
diagnostics [ 43;44;62], where precision is critical, and autonomous driving [ 50], where safety-critical decisions depend
on both visual and textual inputs.
The integration of external knowledge into VLMs introduces significant security risks, particularly through poisoning
attacks targeting the knowledge database [ 63]. These attacks manipulate the model to execute the attacker’s desired
behavior by injecting misleading or harmful information into its knowledge base. While knowledge poisoning attacks
have been well-explored in single-modal RAG systems [ 63;51;60], its implications for multimodal systems remain
unexplored. Existing attacks predominantly focus on individual modalities, failing to account for the intricate dynamics
inherent in multimodal RAG systems that retrieve information based on the fusion of the image and text features. As
a result, these approaches cannot be directly applied to multimodal RAG, as poisoning only the single modal data
reduces the attack’s effectiveness due to the difficulty of retrieving the poisoned samples. To bridge this gap, we
propose Poisoned-MRAG , the firstknowledge poisoning attack specifically designed for multimodal RAG systems.
Poisoned-MRAG leverages the vulnerabilities in both the retrieval and generation processes to execute highly effective
poisoning attacks through the interaction between modalities.
Threat Model. In Poisoned-MRAG, we focus on the retrieval task involving both text and image modalities, where
both the query and corresponding retrieved candidates are image-text pairs. Given the selected target queries, thearXiv:2503.06254v1  [cs.CR]  8 Mar 2025

Figure 1: Overview of Poisoned-MRAG. In the attacking stage, the attacker creates malicious image-text pairs, which
are then collected by multimodal RAG into the knowledge database alongside the benign pairs. In the inference stage,
the malicious pairs are ranked higher than the benign ones, influencing the VLM to generate responses aligned with the
attacker’s desired outcome.
attacker will assign a desired (target) answer to each one. The attacker’s goal is to inject a few malicious image-text
pairs into the knowledge database, causing the VLM to produce the target answer by leveraging the top- kretrieved
candidates from the corrupted knowledge database. We implement a no-box attack in which the attacker has no internal
information of the knowledge database or the VLM in the multimodal RAG system. Specifically, the attacker lacks
access to the pairs within the knowledge database, does not know the VLM’s name or parameters, and cannot interact
with the model. Depending on whether the attacker has access to the retriever, we consider the restricted-access setting
and the full-access setting.
The proposed attack introduces severe risks to safety-critical applications of multimodal RAG, such as recommendation
systems, healthcare, and autonomous driving, where accuracy and reliability are crucial. For example, the attacker
could mislead the VLM into generating misinformation, promote a specific brand when queried about products (e.g.,
promoting the attacker’s desired brand like “Vanguard Rover” when shown a Range Rover in the queried image), or
induce incorrect medical diagnoses, such as falsely suggesting a patient is in critical condition, leading to unnecessary
treatments. In autonomous driving, the attacker could manipulate system signals, compromising the safety of the driver.
Poisoned-MRAG. Our attack relies on two essential conditions: retrieval and generation. The retrieval condition
guarantees the malicious image-text pairs are retrieved from the database, making them relevant to the target query.
The generation condition ensures the VLM produces the target answer when leveraging the malicious image-text pairs.
We develop an autonomous solution to construct components of our malicious injected pairs, ensuring both conditions
are satisfied. Specifically, we optimize the image and text components to maximize similarity between the malicious
image-text pair and the query, and use a surrogate VLM to generate text descriptions that, when processed by the victim
VLM, yield the desired target answer. The method distinguishes between two attack settings: the dirty-label attack,
where the image and text are not semantically aligned (applicable in both restricted-access and full-access settings); and
theclean-label attack, where the image and text are aligned for stealth (formulated under the full-access setting). For
the dirty-label attack, we develop a simple and highly effective approach, while for the clean-label attack, we employ a
gradient-based method while maintaining computational efficiency.
Evaluation. We evaluate our attack framework through extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and OVEN datasets,
demonstrating its superior performance over five baseline methods, including prompt injection attacks, traditional PGD
attacks, and PoisonedRAG, across seven black-box VLMs and one white-box VLM. Our attack consistently achieves
high success rates, with nearly perfect retrieval and generation outcomes. For example, under the clean-label attack, the
generation attack success rate for the victim model Claude-3.5-Sonnet is 94%, while the dirty-label attack achieves
98%, by injecting 5 malicious image-text pairs into the InfoSeek knowledge database of 481,782 pairs. We highlight
the critical role of each attack component in Poisoned-MRAG, with the full configuration significantly outperforming
simplified versions. Additionally, our clean-label method remains computationally efficient, achieving high success
rates in under 400 iterations. These results underscore the effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability of our attack,
marking it as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.
We employ comprehensive defense strategies against Poisoned-MRAG, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal,
structure-driven mitigation, and purification. Paraphrasing reduces clean-label ASRs but has little impact on dirty-label
attacks. Duplicate removal is ineffective against clean-label attacks but weakens dirty-label attacks. Structure-driven
2

defenses, such as image-pair, text-pair, and retrieve-then-merge retrieval, reduce attack success rates but come at the
cost of utility. Purification proves to be effective against clean-label attacks but demonstrates limited effectiveness
against dirty-label attacks. Additionally, the computational cost associated with purification is significant, requiring
substantial processing power and extended runtime, making it less practical for large-scale deployments.
Our contributions are as follows:
•We propose Poisoned-MRAG, the first knowledge poisoning attack framework designed specifically for
multimodal RAG systems.
•We derive two cross-modal solutions to fulfill the two conditions—retrieval and generation—that are necessary
for an effective attack on multimodal RAG.
•We evaluate Poisoned-MRAG across multiple knowledge databases and victim VLMs. Our attack significantly
outperforms all baseline methods.
•We explore various defense strategies against Poisoned-MRAG, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal,
structure-driven mitigation, and purification.

2.1 Multimodal RAG
Recent advances in LLMs and vision-language training have led to multimodal systems excelling in tasks like visual
question answering (VQA), image captioning, and text-to-image generation. Early works focused on end-to-end
multimodal models with knowledge stored in parameters, such as RA-CM3 [ 47], BLIP-2 [ 24], and the “visualize before
you write” paradigm [ 61]. To overcome the limitations of parameter-only knowledge storage, researchers integrated
RAG into multimodal settings. For instance, MuRAG [ 5] jointly retrieves images and text, while VisRAG [ 49] preserves
layout information by embedding entire document images. These studies show that multimodal RAG improves factual
accuracy and expressiveness when handling complex visual or textual inputs.
Meanwhile, domain-specific multimodal RAG approaches have tackled high-stakes applications that require reliable
factuality. MMed-RAG [ 43] and RULE [ 44] propose medical domain-aware retrieval strategies combined with fine-
tuning techniques to decrease hallucinations in clinical report generation and VQA, providing substantial improvements
in factual correctness. Similarly, AlzheimerRAG [ 22] employs a PubMed-based retrieval pipeline to handle textual and
visual data in biomedical literature, and RAG-Driver [ 50] leverages in-context demonstrations to enhance transparency
and generalizability for autonomous driving. Moreover, approaches like Enhanced Multimodal RAG-LLM [ 46] incor-
porate structured scene representations for improved object recognition, spatial reasoning, and content understanding,
highlighting the importance of integrating domain knowledge and visual semantics for robust multimodal RAG.
2.2 Existing Attacks to VLMs
Various attacks on VLMs have been developed, including adversarial perturbation attacks, backdoor attacks, black-box
attacks, and cross-modal attacks. Adversarial perturbation attacks make subtle input changes to cause incorrect outputs.
For example, Schlarmann et al. [ 33] used Latent Diffusion Models to add minimal image perturbations, impairing
VLMs’ generation and question-answering abilities. AdvDiffVLM [ 13] applies optimal transport in diffusion models to
create transferable adversarial examples, boosting attack efficiency across different models and tasks. Additionally,
Zhao et al. [ 57] alter cross-modal alignments to disrupt downstream tasks, highlighting the vulnerability of visual
inputs to manipulation. Backdoor attacks insert hidden triggers into models, enabling attacker-defined behaviors
upon specific inputs. InstructTA [ 39] manipulates large VLMs by generating malicious instructions and optimizing
adversarial samples to control outputs. Image Hijacks [ 3] disguise inputs to mislead VLMs into producing irrelevant
descriptions, exposing multimodal models’ vulnerabilities to visual manipulation. Similarly, Fu et al. [ 11] demonstrate
how adversarial examples can force unintended actions in VLMs.
In addition, AnyAttack [ 53] introduces a self-supervised framework to create adversarial images without target labels,
improving adaptability in various tasks and data sets. A VIBench [ 52] offers a comprehensive evaluation framework
that assesses VLMs under black-box adversarial conditions, including image, text, and content bias attacks to identify
vulnerabilities. Additionally, other approaches [ 48;21;42] employ techniques such as dual universal adversarial
perturbations and agent robustness evaluation to simultaneously manipulate both visual and textual inputs, thereby
increasing attack complexity and effectiveness.

2.3 Existing Attacks to RAG-aided LLMs
Adversarial attacks on RAG systems have evolved in sophistication, exploiting various vulnerabilities. Zhang et
al. [55] introduced retrieval poisoning attacks, demonstrating how small changes in the retrieval corpus can significantly
impact LLM applications. Zhong et al. [ 59] showed that embedding malicious content can deceive retrieval models
without affecting the generation phase. PoisonedRAG [ 63] targeted closed-domain question-answering systems by
injecting harmful paragraphs into the knowledge database, while GARAG [ 9] exploited document perturbations, such
as typographical errors, to disrupt both retrieval and generation. Expanding on these approaches, BadRAG [ 45]
embeds semantic triggers to selectively alter retrieval outcomes, and LIAR [ 37] utilizes a dual-optimization strategy to
manipulate both retrieval and generation processes, misleading outputs across models and knowledge bases.
Additionally, AgentPoison [ 7] introduced backdoor attacks by injecting malicious samples into memory or knowledge
bases, increasing the retrieval of harmful examples. Shafran et al. [ 34] and Chaudhari et al. [ 4] presented jamming and
trigger-based attacks, respectively, challenging RAG robustness by preventing responses or forcing integrity-violating
content. Recent advancements include RAG-Thief [ 19], an agent-based framework for large-scale extraction of private
data from RAG applications using self-improving mechanisms, and direct LLM manipulation [ 25], which employs
simple prefixes and adaptive prompts to bypass context protections and generate malicious outputs.
3 Problem Formulation
3.1 Formulating Multimodal RAG System
A multimodal RAG system consists of three components, the knowledge database D, the retriever R, and the VLM.
Knowledge Database. The knowledge database Din a multimodal RAG typically comprises documents collected
from various sources, such as Wikipedia [ 41] and Reddit [ 31], and can include various modalities such as images [ 20],
tables [ 20] and videos [ 50]. In this paper, we focus on two primary modalities: images and texts. To represent their
combined modality, we use a set of dimage-text pairs D={D1, D2, D3, ..., D d}to form the database. For every
Di, there’s an image Iiand a paragraph of corresponding text Ti, such that Di=Ii⊕Ti, where i= 1,2, . . . , d and
⊕denotes the integration of these components. This pairing enables the retriever to consider both visual and textual
similarities when processing a query, thereby enhancing the relevance of the retrieval.
Retriever. The retriever typically employs multimodal embedding models such as CLIP to embed images. Since our
focus is primarily on the retrieval of image-text pairs, we define the retrieval process as follows: When the retriever
receives a query Qi=˙Ii⊕˙Ti, it returns the top- kimage-text pairs with the highest similarity scores from the knowledge
database D. The retrieval process can be formalized as:
RETRIEVE (Q,D, k) = Topk
Di∈D(Sim( f(Q), f(Di))). (1)
Here, the function Sim(f(Q), f(Di))computes the similarity scores of QandDiusing the embedding function f.
The similarity scores can be measured in various ways depending on the specific Remployed. For simplicity, we use
R(Q,D)to represent the top- kretrieved image-text pair.
R(Q,D) =RETRIEVE (Q,D, k). (2)
Additionally, real-world systems may support retrieval of a single modality, either image or text. In such scenarios, the
system can isolate and utilize only the relevant modality. This is achieved by setting the non-required modality to null,
ensuring that the retrieval process focuses exclusively on the pertinent data type.
VLM. The VLM in the multimodal RAG system receives the query Qfrom the user input and the top- kretrieved
image-text pairs R(Q,D)from the retriever, then uses the retrieved multimodal information to generate an answer for
such query. We use VLM( Q, R (Q,D))to represent the answer of the VLM when queried with Q.
3.2 Threat Model
We define the threat model based on the attacker’s goal, knowledge, and capabilities.
Attacker’s Goal. Suppose an attacker selects an arbitrary set of Mqueries (called target queries ), denoted by
Q={Q1, Q2, . . . , Q M}. For each target query Qi, the attacker chooses an arbitrary attacker-desired answer Ai(called
thetarget answer ), thus forming a set of target answers A={A1, A2, . . . , A M}. Here, each query Qiconsists of an
image ˙Iiand a query text ˙Ti, so that Qi=˙Ii⊕˙Ti. For instance, the attacker might pick a target query asking “Which
building is shown in the attached photo?” together with an image of the White House, but deliberately specify the target
4

answer Aias “Buckingham Palace”. Given these Mselected Qand their corresponding A, the attacker aims to corrupt
the knowledge database Din a multimodal RAG system by injecting a small number of malicious image-text pairs.
In doing so, when the system’s VLM is queried with any target query Qi, it will produce the attacker’s chosen target
answer Ai. Note that the target answer is provided only in textual format, aligning with real-world VQA tasks.
Attacker’s Knowledge. We characterize the attacker’s knowledge based on their access to the knowledge database
D, the retriever R, and the VLM within the multimodal RAG system. We assume that the attacker cannot access
the composition of D, nor can they identify or query the VLM. In other words, the attacker does not know the name
of the VLM or any of its internal parameters. Consequently, we focus on the black-box VLMs, which are more
likely to be adopted in complex systems due to their superior performance in VQA tasks compared to white-box
models[ 54]. Depending on the attacker’s ability to access the retriever R, we consider two distinct attack scenarios. In
therestricted-access setting, the attacker lacks direct interaction with R. By contrast, the full-access setting grants the
attacker complete knowledge of R, including its structure and parameters. This distinction reflects realistic cases where
different attackers possess varying levels of access to system components. Our restricted-access setting represents
a challenging threat model, where the attacker has neither knowledge nor access to any component of the entire
multimodal RAG system. In this context, we propose that our attack functions as a no-box attack .
Attacker’s Capability. We assume that the attacker can inject Nmalicious image-text pairs for each target query Qi
intoD, where N≪d. This reflects a real-world scenario in which Dcontains a massive number of image-text pairs,
while the attacker can only compromise a small fraction of them. Formally, let ˜Ij
iand˜Tj
idenote the malicious image
and text for the j-th injected pair associated with a particular query Qi. We define each malicious pair as Pj
i=˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj
i,
where i∈ {1,2, . . . , M }indexes the target queries, and j∈ {1,2, . . . , N }indexes the malicious pairs injected for
each query. By introducing these carefully designed pairs into D, the attacker aims to manipulate the multimodal RAG
system’s retrieval and generation processes, ultimately causing the VLM to produce attacker-chosen responses for
specific inputs.
3.3 Formulating the Optimization Problem
Our goal is to construct a set of Nimage-text pairs P={Pj
i=˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj
i|i= 1,2, . . . , M, j = 1,2, . . . , N }such that
the VLM in a RAG system produces the target answer Aifor the target question Qiwhen utilizing the top- kimage-text
pairs retrieved from the corrupted knowledge database D ∪ P . The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:
max
P1
MMX
i=1I(VLM ( Qi, R(Qi,D ∪ P )) =Ai), (3)
s.t.,R(Qi,D ∪ P ) =RETRIEVE (Qi,D ∪ P , k), i={1,2, . . . , M }, (4)
where R(·)denotes the top- kretrieval operator on the corrupted database D ∪ P , and I(·)is an indicator function
evaluating to 1if the VLM’s final output equals the attacker-specified answer Ai, and 0otherwise. Under this
formulation, the attacker seeks to maximize the fraction of queries {Q1, . . . , Q M}for which maliciously injected pairs
successfully steer the VLM to produce {A1, . . . , A M}.
The proposed attack presents significant risks, as it has the potential to manipulate VLMs into generating attacker-chosen,
misleading information across various contexts.
For example, when queried about the brand of a product in an image, the VLM could incorrectly promote a brand
desired by the attacker. More critically, in medical applications where a medical VLM leverages a RAG system for
enhanced image-based diagnosis, the attack could result in false diagnoses, potentially leading to severe errors in patient
care. In scenarios where multi-modal RAG is used for enhancing autonomous driving systems, the attacker could
manipulate key signals, leading to life-threatening incidents. Given the broad range of applications for multi-modal
RAG systems, the potential impact of this attack underscores the need for careful consideration and risk management.
4 Poisoned-MRAG
In this section, we outline the methodology of Poisoned-MRAG. Building on the work of PoisonedRAG[ 63], we
attribute the success of our attack to two fundamental conditions: the retrieval condition and the generation condition.
As depicted in Figure 1, our attack methodology encompasses the derivation of these conditions and the subsequent
construction of malicious image-text pairs to satisfy them.
5

4.1 Deriving Two Necessary Conditions for an Effective Attack
We aim to construct Nimage-text pairs ( Pj
i, j= 1,2, . . . , N ) for each target query Qi, ensuring that the VLM in the
multimodal RAG system generates the target answer Aiwhen leveraging R(Qi,D ∪ P ). Since Equation 3 and 4 are
non-differentiable, we focus on deriving two necessary conditions for the problem, rather than attempting to solve the
equations directly. Specifically, we derive the retrieval condition from Equation 4 and the generation condition from
Equation 3.
The Retrieval Condition. This condition ensures that the constructed image-text pairs Pj
i(forj= 1,2, . . . , N ) are
likely to be retrieved when the top- kretrieval function RETRIEVE (Qi,D ∪ P , k)is applied to the query Qi. This
guarantees the relevance of Pj
ito the query. To satisfy this condition, the similarity score between Pj
iandQimust be
higher than the similarity score between Di(i= 1,2, . . . , d ) and Qi. This requirement is formally expressed as:
Sim(f(Qi), f(Pj
i))>Sim(f(Qi), f(Di)),∀i= 1,2, . . . , d, j = 1,2, . . . , N. (5)
Refer to the explanation of Equation 1 to see how to calculate the similarity scores.
The Generation Condition. This condition ensures that the VLM generates AiforQiwhen utilizing R(Qi,D ∪ P )as
the retrieved information. To satisfy this condition, the VLM must produce Aiwhen provided with Pj
ialone. This
requirement can be expressed as:
VLM
Qi, Pj
i
=Ai. (6)
The challenge of fulfilling these two necessary conditions is addressed by dividing the construction of the injected
image-text pairs Pj
iinto two distinct components: Rj
i, which is crafted to satisfy the retrieval condition, and Gj
i, which
is crafted to satisfy the generation condition. Specifically, the final injected pairs take the form:
Pj
i=Rj
i⊕Gj
i. (7)
By constructing different parts of Pj
ito separately fulfill the two conditions, the order in which the conditions are
satisfied can be reversed. The subsequent subsections first discuss the achievement of the generation condition, followed
by the explanation of the retrieval condition.
4.2 Achieving the Generation Condition
Optimizing both image and text to satisfy the generation condition, as indicated in Equation 6, represents an ideal
yet challenging scenario. Existing methods for generation control attacks through images on black-box VLMs are
either computationally infeasible or exhibit limited effectiveness in practice [ 26]. Consequently, the present approach
focuses exclusively on crafting the textual component to fulfill the generation condition. Specifically, the objective is to
utilize a VLM to autonomously construct a description Gj
isuch that VLM( Qi, Gj
i) =Ai. To expand the malicious text
collection to the desired inject number, each generated description is paraphrased Ntimes, thereby generating a diverse
set of texts to increase the likelihood of successful retrievals across various queries. While such paraphrasing may
introduce minor variations that may lower the success rate, prioritizing a time-efficient generation process is crucial for
achieving scalability in large-scale deployments.
Given the black-box nature of the multimodal RAG system, direct access to the VLM and its internal mechanisms
is unavailable. To address this limitation, we employ GPT-4o as a surrogate model to iteratively refine the generated
description. Initially, GPT-4o generates a potential description based on the target query Qiand the target answer
Ai. This description is then refined through iterative adjustments until GPT-4o produces the desired output Ai. To
autonomously validate whether the refined description achieves the desired output, an LLM-as-a-Judge [58] mechanism
is applied. In this setup, GPT-4o evaluates the model’s response to the crafted description, determining whether it
matches Ai. This automated validation ensures that effective descriptions are retained, streamlining the refinement
process. The majority of descriptions achieve the desired output in the first iteration, highlighting the effectiveness of
our approach. If a description fails to produce the desired output after reaching the maximum number of attempts, the
last attempted description is used as the final description. The detailed steps of this process are illustrated in Algorithm 1,
prompts for refining descriptions are provided in Appendix A.1.
4.3 Achieving the Retrieval Condition
To satisfy the retrieval condition outlined in Equation 5, both the image ˜Ij
iand the text ˜Tj
iare crafted to maximize
the similarity: Sim(f(˙Ii⊕˙Ti), f(˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj
i)), where ˙Iidenotes the query image and ˙Tidenotes the query text. The
subsequent sections will describe our approach for constructing ˜Ij
iand˜Tj
iin order to meet the retrieval condition.

4.3.1 Crafting the Image
Dirty-Label Attack. In the restricted-access setting, where the attacker lacks access to the retriever, a primary challenge
is the inability to directly access the embedding function for the similarity function Sim. To address this, the dirty-label
attack is introduced, where ˜Ij
iand˜Tj
ido not necessarily need to be semantically aligned. This approach employs a
heuristic method by directly utilizing the query image ˙Iias the injected image. The underlying rationale is that, keeping
˜Tj
iunchanged, maintaining ˜Ij
i=˙Iimaximizes the similarity Sim(f(˙Ii⊕˙Ti), f(˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj
i)).
Although this approach appears straightforward, it’s both easy to implement and effective, as demonstrated in the
experiment result. It is important to note that since ˜Ij
i=˙Ii, the addition of the injected image does not interfere with
the previously achieved generation condition.
Clean-Label Attack. In the full-access setting, where the attacker has complete access to the retriever, the dirty-label
attack remains a viable approach. To broaden the scope of attacks, we propose the clean-label attack. Unlike the
dirty-label attack, the clean-label approach ensures that the image and its corresponding text are semantically aligned in
a way that is coherent and meaningful from a human perception standpoint. This formulation is motivated by the need
for attack stealthiness and alignment with the attacker’s objectives.
Figure 2: Crafting the image to maximize image-
text pair similarity in our clean-label attack.Notably, when images are uploaded to strictly moderated platforms,
such as Wikipedia or other public websites, both images and their
accompanying descriptions are often subject to manual review. In the
case of the dirty-label attack, the discrepancy between the uploaded
image and its description renders the attack detectable under stringent
content moderation. Conversely, a clean-label attack circumvents
such censorship by maintaining semantic alignment between the
image and its description, thereby facilitating a successful execution.
Consider a different scenario, an attacker aiming to manipulate the
VLM for fraudulent promotion might upload a product image and a
detailed description to an online shopping website. Here, maintaining
semantic consistency between the product image and its description
is crucial for preserving the authenticity of the sales listing.
To implement the proposed clean-label attack, semantically aligned
image-text pairs are generated. This is achieved by leveraging
DALL ·E-3 [ 29] to produce images based on text descriptions col-
lected in Section 4.2, resulting in a set of base images denoted as
B. Specifically, for a base text description Gj
i, the generated base
image is represented as Bj
i. The prompt used for image generation
is detailed in Appendix A.2. A significant challenge in this setting
arises from the potential dissimilarity between the generated base
image Bj
iand the target query image Ii, leading to a low similarity
score between Qj
iandPj
i. To address this, a gradient-based optimization method is employed to refine the generated
image, thereby aligning it more closely with the query image. Figure 2 illustrates the optimization process.
7

Our objective is to maximize the similarity score between the target query image-text pair and the injected image-text
pairSim(f(˙Ii⊕˙Ti), f(˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj
i)). To achieve this, an initial random perturbation δj
iis applied to Bj
i, and it is iteratively
optimized by minimizing the loss between Qj
iandPj
i, where Pj
i= (Bj
i+δj
i)⊕˜Tj
i. The loss function is defined as
follows:
Lretrieve (Qi, Pj
i(δj
i)) = 1 −CosSim (Qi,(Bj
i+δj
i)⊕˜Tj
i), (8)
where we use cosine similarity ( CosSim ) as our default setting to quantify the similarity between the target and crafted
pairs. To constrain the perturbation size, we utilize the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method [ 27], which projects
the perturbation back onto an l∞-norm ball after each iteration.
4.3.2 Crafting the Text
To enhance the probability of the crafted text being retrieved by the retrieval system, a strategic concatenation approach
is employed, wherein the query text ˙Tiis prefixed to the generated description Gj
i, resulting in the concatenated text
˜Tj
i=˙Ti⊕Gj
i. This approach is primarily motivated by the need to significantly enhance the semantic relevance,
contextual alignment, and overall coherence between the given query and the crafted text, thereby improving the
likelihood that the crafted pairs are selected during the retrieval process.
In summary, the crafted image-text pairs Pj
i=˜Ij
i⊕˜Tj

Equation 9 represents the dirty-label setting, wherein the query image is utilized directly to maximize similarity.
Conversely, Equation 10 embodies the clean-label setting, where a perturbation δis introduced to ensure semantic
alignment with the text while maintaining stealthiness.
Referring to Equation 7, the crafted pairs are partitioned into Rj
iandGj
i, corresponding to the fulfillment of the retrieval
and generation conditions, respectively. In both settings, the initial two components are constructed as Rj
ito satisfy
the retrieval condition, thereby ensuring that the malicious pairs effectively manipulate the retrieval process without
compromising generation quality.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Experimental Setup
5.1.1 Data Preparation
Datasets. We thank the authors of UniIR [ 40] for crafting the below datasets suited for image-text pair retrieval task in
multimodal RAG system.
•InfoSeek [ 6].InfoSeek is a VQA benchmark designed to evaluate models on their ability to answer information-
seeking questions. These questions require knowledge beyond what is typically accessible through common
sense reasoning. The benchmark consists of a corpus comprising 481,782 image-text pairs, i.e. D1=
{D1, D2, D3, ..., D d}, where d= 481 ,782.
•OVEN [ 16].Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition (OVEN) involves the task of associating an image with
a corresponding Wikipedia entity based on a given text query. This task challenges models to identify the
correct entity from a pool of over six million potential Wikipedia entries. In our work, OVEN is represented
by a corpus of 335,135 image-text pairs, i.e. D2={D1, D2, D3, ..., D d}, where d= 335 ,135.
Target Queries and Answers. We select 50 queries from each of the datasets. It is important to note that the target
answers can be arbitrarily chosen by the attacker. To facilitate the experiment, we use GPT-4 to generate target answers
that intentionally differ from the ground-truth answers based on the target queries. The prompt for generating these
answers can be found in Appendix A.3. Additionally, we employ the LLM-as-a-Judge framework [ 58] to ensure that
the generated target answers are distinct from the ground-truth answers.
Base Images and Texts. Recall in Section 4.3.1, we obtain a set of image-text pairs that are semantically aligned for
our clean-label attack. We refer to these semantically aligned pairs as base image-text pairs {B, G}, with the images B
being termed as base images and the texts Gas base texts.

5.1.2 Multimodal RAG Settings
Knowledge Database. We utilize the InfoSeek and OVEN datasets as separate and independent knowledge databases
for our experiments. Both corpora consist of extensive and diverse collections of image-text pairs, carefully curated to
reflect real-world scenarios involving large-scale, multimodal knowledge bases.
Retriever. In the default setting of our experiment, we employ the CLIP-SF [ 40] model from UniIR as the retriever.
CLIP-SF is a CLIP-based model specifically fine-tuned for multimodal retrieval tasks. In our ablation studies, we
extend our experiments to incorporate ViT-B-32 and ViT-H-14 [ 8], enabling us to evaluate the transferability of our
approach across different model architectures and scaling variations.
VLM. We deploy a set of powerful commercial and open-source models as the victim VLMs in our main experiments,
including GPT-4o [ 17], GPT-4 turbo [ 30], Claude-3.5 Sonnet [ 1], Claude-3 Haiku [ 1], Gemini-2 [ 10], Gemini-1.5-pro
[38], Llama-3.2 90B [ 28], Qwen-vl-max [ 2]. By default, we use Claude-3.5-sonnet as the victim model in the baseline
comparison and ablation study.
5.1.3 Attack Settings
Unless otherwise stated, we adopt the following hyperparameters for our attack: we inject N = 5 malicious image-text
pairs for each target query. The text Gis generated by GPT-4o. The retriever retrieves the top- kcandidates ( k= 3),
which are then fed as input with the input query to VLM. In the clean-label attack, we set the perturbation intensity
ϵ= 32/255, and use cosine similarity as the distance metric in optimizing δ. In our default experimental setting,
convergence is typically achieved after 400 optimization iterations to satisfy the retrieval condition, requiring less than
one minute per image when executed on a single A6000 GPU.
5.1.4 Evaluation Metrics
Recall. Recall@k (abbreviated as Recall) represents the probability that the top- kimage-text pairs retrieved by the
retriever from the knowledge database contain an image-text pair related to the query. Denote the query and its
corresponding image-text pair as QiandDi, Recall can be expressed as:
Recall =1
MX
Di∈QI(Di∈R(Qi,D)). (11)
ACC. Accuracy (ACC) is the proportion of queries for evaluation that the VLM’s response VLM (Q, R(Q,D))
corresponds to the ground-truth answer with the retrieved top- kimage-text pairs as knowledge for the answer generation.
ASR-R. Attack success rate for retrieval (ASR-R) denotes the ratio of the malicious image-text pairs that are successfully
retrieved in the top- kcandidates. We formulate ASR-R as:
ASR−R=1
MX
Qi∈QI(Pi∈R(Qi,D ∪ P )). (12)
ASR-G. Attack success rate for generation (ASR-G) represents the rate of queries that the victim VLM responds the
target answer, which is judged by GPT-4o. We define it as:
ASR−G=1
MX
Qi∈QJudge (VLM (Qi, R(Qi,D ∪ P )), Ai). (13)
5.2 Compared Baselines
Based on the constructed base image-text pairs {B, G}, we employ a series of poisoning attack and adversarial example
generation methods for comparison, including corpus poisoning attack, textual prompt injection attack, visual prompt
injection attack, PoisonedRAG and CLIP PGD attack. We introduce these baseline methods in detail as follows:
Corpus Poisoning Attack. For this setting, we directly inject the constructed base image-text pairs {B, G}into the
knowledge database as poisoned samples.
Textual Prompt Injection Attack [ 12;15].This method constructs the realization of the generation condition as an
explicit text prompt and injects it into the base text G. In this setting, we keep the corresponding base image unchanged.
The prompt injection text template is shown in Appendix A.4.
9

Visual Prompt Injection Attack[ 36;26].This method aims to achieve the attack target by embedding the prompt
injection text in the visual features of images. We add perturbations to the base image Bto minimize the distance
between the perturbed image features and the prompt injection text features.
PoisonedRAG [ 63].The poisoned texts are injected into the text knowledge database in this approach, which is divided
into two parts to satisfy the retrieval condition and the generation condition respectively. In our experiments, we used
the textual query to obtain and refine G(refer to A.4 for prompt template), then concatenate the target query text ˙Ton
G. We then use the DALLE-3 to obtain corresponding images of G.
CLIP PGD Attack. In this setting, we add adversarial perturbations to the base image Bto minimize the distance
between the perturbed image (Bj
i+δ)and the target query image ˙I.

Poisoned-MRAG Achieves high ASRs. Table 1 delineates the performance of Poisoned-MRAG across various victim
VLMs on the InfoSeek and OVEN datasets. The results reveal that Poisoned-MRAG consistently attains high ASR-R
and ASR-G across all VLMs under both the clean-label and dirty-label settings. For InfoSeek, the dirty-label attack
achieves an average ASR-R of 1.00 and ASR-G of 0.98, with perfect ASR-R and ASR-G scores of 1.00 on models
like Gemini-2 flash-exp and Claude-3 Haiku. The dirty-label attack achieves slightly lower ASR-R and ASR-G
averages of 0.97 and 0.90, respectively, but maintains high effectiveness, particularly on Claude-3.5 Sonnet and
Qwen-vl max (ASR-R and ASR-G of 0.94 and 0.92). Similarly, For the OVEN dataset, dirty-label attack also achieves
strong results, with an average ASR-R and ASR-G of 1.00 and 0.94, and maximum scores of 0.96 on models like
Gemini-2 flash-exp and Qwen-vl max. Clean-label attack yields an average ASR-R and ASR-G of 0.95 and 0.86,

findings underscore the robustness and adaptability of Poisoned-
MRAG across diverse datasets and VLM architectures. Further-
more, the uniformity of high ASR-R and ASR-G values across a
spectrum of models demonstrates the transferability of Poisoned-
MRAG. This consistency suggests that Poisoned-MRAG effec-
tively compromises multimodal VLM systems irrespective of un-
derlying architectural differences or varying capabilities. Addition-
ally, the minimal variance in ASRs among different VLMs indicates
that Poisoned-MRAG reliably maintains high performance even
when targeting models with differing levels of sophistication.
Poisoned-MRAG Outperforms Baselines. Table 2 provides a
comprehensive comparison, illustrating that Poisoned-MRAG con-
sistently achieves superior ASRs (ASR-R and ASR-G) compared
to baseline methods across both the InfoSeek and OVEN datasets.
For the InfoSeek dataset, Poisoned-MRAG delivers exceptional
performance, achieving an ASR-R of 0.97 under the clean-label
10

attack and 1.00 under the dirty-label attack. Similarly, it attains ASR-G scores of 0.94 (clean-label) and 0.98 (dirty-label).
These results substantially surpass the strongest baseline, CLIP PGD, which achieves only 0.19 for ASR-R and 0.18
for ASR-G. The trend remains consistent in the OVEN dataset, where Poisoned-MRAG achieves an ASR-R of 0.95
(clean-label) and 1.00 (dirty-label), alongside ASR-G scores of 0.88 (clean-label) and 0.96 (dirty-label). In stark
contrast, the best-performing baseline, CLIP PGD, achieves notably lower scores, with ASR-R at 0.63 and ASR-G
at 0.32. These findings demonstrate that both attack strategies of Poisoned-MRAG consistently outperform existing
baselines by a substantial margin, highlighting their effectiveness and robustness across datasets.

Figure 3: Impact of the number of retrieved candidates kand injected malicious pairs N, evaluated on InfoSeek.
Impact of Nandk.Figure 3 demonstrates the performance of Poisoned-MRAG under different settings of the number
of injected pairs Nand the number of retrieved candidates k. In panel 3a, where N= 5, the attack shows remarkable
effectiveness when k≤N, with ASR-R close to 1.00 for both clean-label and dirty-label attacks. The dirty-label attack
achieves nearly perfect generalization, with an ASR-G of 1.00, while the clean-label attack performs slightly lower at
0.90 ASR-G, yet still exhibits strong capabilities. This indicates that our approach is highly effective when the number
of candidates is small and the attack can maintain both high relevance and generalization. When k > N , the sharp
drop in ASR-G for clean-label attacks suggests that the performance is impacted when the retrieval set grows too large
relative to the number of injected pairs. The impact is particularly pronounced in the clean-label attack, where the ˜I
deviates substantially from the images of benign pairs. This significant divergence enables the VLM to effectively
differentiate between benign pairs of Q, thereby producing the correct answer. However, the ASR-G for the dirty-label
attack still remains beyond 0.80, demonstrating strong effectiveness. In panel 3b, where N= 10 , both ASR-R and
ASR-G stay near 1.00 for all values of k, suggesting that increasing Nmitigates the performance drop seen with smaller
N. The results on Claude-3-haiku and OVEN are shown in Appendix C.2.

attack consistently achieves high ASR-Rs (1.00, 0.99,
and 0.98 for CLIP-SF, ViT-B-32, ViT-H-14, respectively),
as well as similarly high ASR-Gs. These results indicate
the strong transferability of the dirty-label attack across
different retrievers. On the other hand, while the clean-label attack also demonstrates effectiveness across all three
retrievers, ViT-B-32 and ViT-H-14 yield slightly lower ASR-R and ASR-G values compared to the default CLIP-SF
model attack, suggesting that the optimal hyperparameter settings for the clean-label attack may vary slightly depending
on the retriever model.

and accuracy across both datasets. As ϵincreases from
8/255 to 32/255, a clear improvement in both ASR-R and
ASR-G is observed, suggesting that larger perturbations
enhance the effectiveness of malicious images in influ-
encing the VLM generation process. For instance, in the
InfoSeek dataset, as ϵincreases, ASR-R rises from 0.89
to 0.97, and ASR-G improves from 0.74 to 0.94, accompanied by a drop in ACC from 0.18 to 0.04. Figure 8 in
Appendix B visualizes the perturbed images and the corresponding perturbations at three different ϵvalues. As ϵ
increases, the perturbation becomes more noticeable in the image. However, even with ϵ= 32/255, it remains difficult
for human reviewers to detect, highlighting the stealthiness of our clean-label attack.

performance of two distance metrics, Cosine Similarity
(CosSim) and L2-Norm, for optimizing images in our
clean-label attack on InfoSeek and OVEN. CosSim
consistently outperforms L2-Norm, achieving higher
ASR-R and ASR-G across both datasets, with ASR-R
reaching 0.97 and ASR-G reaching 0.94 on InfoSeek.
This demonstrates that CosSim is a more effective approach in our default setting, aligning well with the retriever’s use
of the normalized inner product to calculate similarity scores and select the top-k candidates. However, it’s important to
note that L2-Norm also produces competitive results, with ASR-G reaching 0.92 on InfoSeek. This indicates that the
attacker does not need to know the retriever’s inner workings, such as using the inner product for similarity computation,
to successfully perform the attack.
Figure 4: Impact of different loss terms (image-image and
pair-pair) in clean-label attack, evaluated on InfoSeek.Impact of Different Loss Terms. In our clean-label at-
tack, we propose minimizing the loss term that reduces
the embedding distance between the query image-text pair
˙Ii⊕˙Tiand the malicious image-text pair (Bj
i+δ)⊕˜Tj
i,
where i= 1,2, . . . , M andj= 1,2, . . . , N . In this
evaluation, we focus solely on minimizing the embed-
ding distance between the image component ˙Iiand the
perturbed image (Bj
i+δ).
The results, evaluated on the InfoSeek dataset, are shown
in Figure 4. We observe that the ASR-R for minimiz-
ing the image distance is consistently lower than in our
default pair-pair optimization setting. Although the dif-
ference in ASR-R is subtle, it leads to a significant drop in ASR-G, suggesting that the pair-pair formulation of our
optimization method is more effective at generating stronger adversarial examples. We observe a similar trend by
setting ϵ= 16/255, the results are shown in Appendix C.3. This highlights the importance of incorporating both image
and text components in our loss function, leading to a more successful attack.
Figure 5: Impact of iteration number in clean-label
attack, evaluated on InfoSeek.Impact of Iteration Number. In our clean-label attack, we
employ a gradient-based method with an iteration count set
to 400. In this experiment, we examine the effect of varying
iteration numbers on the attack’s performance. The results for
ASR-R, ASR-G, and ACC under different iteration settings are
presented in Figure 5. From the results, we observe that the
attack achieves a notable ASR-R of 0.89 and ASR-G of 0.78
after just 100 iterations, indicating that the attack is highly com-
putationally efficient. This suggests that a significant portion
of the attack’s effectiveness is achieved early on, minimizing
the computational cost for relatively high performance. Beyond
100 iterations, the increase in ASR values begins to plateau,
and the decline in ACC also stabilizes. After 400 iterations,
both the ASR values show minimal further improvement, and
the ACC reaches a near-zero value, indicating that the attack has converged.

nents of the attack are defined in Equation 9 and 10.
We evaluate the attack under three different settings,
each with one component removed, to better under-
stand their contribution to the overall effectiveness.

alternative settings perform significantly worse than our default configuration, which achieves a substantially higher
ASR-R of 0.97 and 0.95, as well as an ASR-G of 0.94 and 0.88 for InfoSeek and OVEN, respectively. This stark
contrast underscores the critical role of our attack’s key components in ensuring its overall effectiveness and robustness.

Dirty-L 1.00 0.95 0.05 1.00 0.95 0.03In the security protection of LLMs, paraphrasing [ 18]
is widely used to defend against prompt-based adver-
sarial attacks in LLMs. Paraphrasing-based defense
reduces the effectiveness of malicious instructions by
reformulating the input text and changing its gram-
matical structure and expression. Specifically, when
receiving user input, the defense system first rewrites
the input using LLM, and then uses the rewritten text
for subsequent processing and response generation. This process can effectively disrupt the malicious input designed by
the attacker, making it difficult for the model to correctly understand or execute it. Referring to [ 63], which paraphrases
the input query to reduce the similarities between the target question and the poisoned text, we evaluate the effectiveness
of paraphrasing in defending against our attacks.
Specifically, for each target query text, we use GPT-4 to generate 5paraphrasing versions while keeping the target query
image unchanged. For each paraphrasing text-image pair, we evaluate ASR-R, ASR-G and ACC under the default attack
setting in Section 5.1.3 and present the results in Table 7. Our clean-label attack demonstrates a moderate susceptibility
to paraphrasing on the InfoSeek dataset. Specifically, the ASR-R decreases from 0.97to0.79, and the ASR-G drops
from 0.94to0.74following the application of the defense. In contrast, the dirty-label attack shows minimal sensitivity
to paraphrasing. After the defense, the ASR-R remains at 1.00for both datasets, while the ASR-G experiences a slight
reduction of 0.03and0.01, respectively. We attribute this observation to the fact that, although paraphrasing reduces
the similarity between the query text and the poisoned text, the dirty-label attack operates with the same settings as the
query image. As a result, the multimodal image-text query can still successfully retrieve the poisoned image-text pair
despite the textual transformation.
6.2 Duplicates Removal
Following [ 63;43], duplicates removal effectively filters out malicious texts and images that may recur in the knowledge
base, thereby mitigating poisoning attacks. In our setting, the clean-label attack generates a base image based on the
base text description through a generative model, which can lead to duplication. Similarly, the dirty-label attack assigns
poisoned samples identical to query images, resulting in duplicate entries. Therefore, we achieve duplicate removal by
comparing the hash values (SHA-256) of the images in the corpus and deleting the image-text pairs corresponding to
the relative values.

out defense in Table 8. We have two key insights.
First, duplicate removal proves ineffective against our
clean-label attack, as the ASR-R, ASR-G and ACC
remain unchanged before and after the defense. This
suggests that no duplicates are introduced when using
poisoned images generated by the generative model
and subjected to adversarial perturbations. Second, the
performance of the dirty-label attack is significantly degraded following duplicate removal. Specifically, ASR drops
from 1.00to0.33, and ASR-G decreases from 0.98to0.54on the InfoSeek dataset. This performance drop occurs
because, in the dirty-label attack, the poisoned images for the same target query are identical. Consequently, after
duplicate removal, the attack is reduced to the setting where N= 1, limiting its effectiveness.

Figure 6: Poisoned-MRAG under structure-driven mitigation, evaluated on InfoSeek.
6.3 Structure-Driven Mitigation
In this subsection, we explore three different multimodal RAG structures as defense strategies against our attack and
assess their impact on no-attack performance. We randomly select 20 textually distinct queries from both InfoSeek and
OVEN for the experiment. Figure 6 presents the results for the ASR-R, ASR-G, and ACC metrics under the no-defense
scenario and the three defense settings tested on InfoSeek, with results on OVEN provided in the Appendix D.
Image-Pair Retrieval. In this setting, the retrieval process is performed using only the query image ˙Ii, defined by
the expression R(Qi,D ∪ P ) =RETRIEVE
˙Ii,D ∪ P , k
,;i= 1,2, . . . , M, k = 3. The defense proves effective in
defending Poisoned-MRAG , as seen with the clean-label attack, where the ASR-R decreases from 0.97 to 0.55 and
ASR-G from 0.95 to 0.60. For the dirty-label attack, ASR-R drops from 1.00 to 0.93 and ASR-G from 1.00 to 0.85.
However, a notable trade-off is observed: the ACC under the no-attack condition drops from 0.95 to 0.35. This suggests
that while the defense method reduces attack success, it comes at the cost of a substantial decline in overall accuracy.
Text-Pair Retrieval. In this setting, only the query text ˙Tiis used for retrieval, following the formulation
R(Qi,D ∪ P ) =RETRIEVE
˙Ti,D ∪ P , k
, i= 1,2, . . . , M, k = 3. The clean-label attack leads to a sharp decrease
in ASR-R from 0.97 to 0.57 and ASR-G from 0.95 to 0.75, while the dirty-label attack results in ASR-R dropping from
1.00 to 0.30 and ASR-G from 1.00 to 0.40. A critical observation is that the ACC under no attack drops from 0.95 to
0.15. The performance drop here is more severe than the Image-Pair Retrieval defense, indicating that while text-based
retrieval is more effective against the attacks, it suffers from an even greater loss in accuracy when no attack is present.
Retrieve-then-Merge Multimodal Retrieval. This defense performs both image-pair and text-pair retrieval indepen-
dently, merging the top 3 results from each modality for a total of 6 retrieved items. The clean-label attack performance
reduces ASR-R from 0.97 to 0.56 and ASR-G from 0.95 to 0.65. For the dirty-label attack, ASR-R drops from 1.00
to 0.62 and ASR-G from 1.00 to 0.85. Notably, ACC under no attack only drops from 0.95 to 0.60, showing a better
balance between attack effectiveness and accuracy retention compared to the other strategies.
6.4 Purification
Figure 7: Poisoned-MRAG under purification.Purification is a standard solution to image perturbation-
based attacks. We employ a Zero-shot Image Purification
method [ 35] for defense, which leverages linear transfor-
mation to remove perturbation information and uses a
diffusion model to restore the original semantic content
of the image. Specifically, we purify all 335,135 images
in the overall OVEN dataset, along with the images used
in the clean and dirty-label attack, and evaluate the effects
of the two attacks, as shown in Figure 7. The results show
that purification has minimal impact on the dirty-label
attack, with ASR-R and ASR-G dropping by only 0.267
and 0.04 respectively after the defense. In contrast, for
the clean-label attack, the injected images contain perturbations, and ASR-R and ASR-G drop by 0.65 and 0.66
after purification, although the accuracy remains 0.20 lower than the original. Notably, even in the absence of an
attack, the accuracy drops significantly from 0.82 to 0.70, indicating a clear trade-off between the effectiveness of the
defense mechanism and the overall system performance. Additionally, the defense process is computationally intensive,
requiring approximately 23 hours on four A100 80GB GPUs.

7 Conclusion
In this work, we introduce Poisoned-MRAG, the first knowledge poisoning attack framework specifically designed
for multimodal RAG systems. We demonstrate that the integration of multimodal knowledge databases into VLMs
induces new vulnerabilities for our Poisoned-MRAG. Through extensive evaluation on multiple datasets and VLMs, our
attack consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves high ASRs. Additionally, we evaluate several defense
strategies, revealing their limitations in countering Poisoned-MRAG. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more
robust defense mechanisms to safeguard multimodal RAG systems against this emerging threat. Interesting future
work includes: 1) Exploring attacks on other modalities in multimodal RAG system, 2) Designing effective black-box
generation control method for image modification for the clean-label attack, and 3) Developing effective defense
strategies.

Figure 9: Length distribution of original knowledge databases and injected texts.
C Evaluation
C.1 Length Distribution
In this section, we analyze the length distribution of the original knowledge database and the injected text. Results
in Figure 9 indicate that while the injected text is slightly shorter on average, the majority of text lengths fall within
the range of [80, 120]. This alignment with the original distribution suggests that the injected texts are designed to
blend seamlessly, making them challenging to filter based on length alone and increasing their resistance to detection
mechanisms.
C.2 Impact of kandN
Figure 10: Impact of k, evaluated with Claude-3-haiku on OVEN. The
number of injected image-text pair is N= 5.In this section, we present additional exper-
imental results examining the impact of k,
evaluated using Claude-3-haiku. The results
in Figure 10 suggest that weaker VLMs are
more vulnerable to both our dirty and clean-
label attacks. Specifically, the clean-label
attack with k < N yields an ASR of ap-
proximately 0.60, nearly doubling the results
observed in Figure 3a, where the ASR was
around 0.30. This highlights the increased
susceptibility of VLMs to adversarial manip-
ulations when the number of retrieved can-
didates ( k) is smaller than the number of in-
jected malicious pairs ( N), further emphasizing the effectiveness of our attack strategy on less robust models.
Figure 11: Impact of k, evaluated with Claude-3-haiku on InfoSeek.
The number of injected image-text pair is N= 5.The evaluation on the OVEN dataset, shown
in Figure 11, reveals similar trends. When
k < N , both ASR-R and ASR-G remain
high, indicating significant model vulnerabil-
ity. As k > N , ASR-R declines steadily with
increasing k, highlighting the role of larger re-
trieval sizes in mitigating the attack’s impact.
In contrast, ASR-G shows less variation and
remains relatively high across all k, suggest-
ing that the attack retains a degree of effec-
tiveness even with greater retrieval diversity.
While the clean-label attack achieves lower
ASR-G compared to the dirty-label attack, it
22

remains effective, maintaining an ASR-R above 0.80. These results confirm that weaker VLMs are especially vulnerable
to both clean-label and dirty-label attack.
C.3 Impact of Loss Term.
Figure 12: Impact of different loss term (image-image), evaluated with
ϵ= 16/255on InfoSeek.In this section, we provide extensive evalu-
ation results for the impact of different loss
terms used in our clean-label attack when
ϵ= 16 /255, illustrated in Figure 12. The
results indicate that the ASR-R for image-
image optimization consistently falls below
that of the pair-pair optimization approach.
This difference is further reflected in the
larger gap observed in the ASR-G, where pair-
pair optimization again demonstrates superior
performance. These findings align with the
trends presented in 5.4, reinforcing that the
pair-pair optimization strategy consistently
outperforms the image-image optimization strategy across various settings. The difference in performance suggests that
the pair-pair optimization more effectively exploits the inherent relationships between malicious and benign examples,
leading to more successful adversarial manipulations. This is because pair-pair optimization considers both image and
text modality, leading to a more satisfying cross-modal perturbation.
D Defense
Figure 13: Our attack under structure-driven mitigation. Evaluated on
OVEN.In this section, we present detailed results for
the structure-driven mitigation approach. Fig-
ure 13 shows a similar trend to Figure 6, in-
dicating that while effective, structure-driven
mitigation incurs a significant utility trade-off.
The text-pair retrieval method achieves the
best defense performance, with both clean-
label and dirty-label ASR-G around 0.20.
However, this comes at the cost of substan-
tial utility loss, as the ACC under the no-
attack setting is nearly zero. On the other
hand, the retrieve-then-merge strategy main-
tains the highest utility, but the ASR-R also
remains the highest, suggesting limited de-
fense capability. These results indicate that
structure-driven mitigation alone is insuffi-
cient to defend Poisoned-MRAG, due to the
large compromise in utility.
E Examples
In this section, we provide some examples of
multimodal RAG framework and Poisoned-
MRAG.

Entry 1:
Boeing 707. The Boeing 707 is an American, long-range, narrow-body airliner, the first jetliner developed and
produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Developed from the Boeing 367-80 prototype first flown in 1954, the
initial first flew on December 20, 1957. Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26,
1958. With versions produced until 1979, the 707 was a swept wing, quadjet with podded engines. Its larger fuselage
cross-section allowed six-abreast economy seating, retained in the later 720, 727, 737, and 757 models. Although it
was not the first commercial jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be widespread and is often credited.
